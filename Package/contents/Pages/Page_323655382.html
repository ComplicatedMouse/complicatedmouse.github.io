<h1 id="Anchor_323655382_h1_1">Approximately how large are the generated patches?</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_323655382_h2_1">About Initial Patches</h2>
<p>AuthoringTool compares the original application to the patched application, and generates a patch that is approximately as large as the existing data that has been updated (only counting the parts of each file that have changed) and the new files that have been added.</p>
<p>For example, in a case where</p>
<ul>
  <li>50 MiB of the file were updated</li>
  <li>100 MiB of new files were added</li>
</ul>
<p>the size of the initial patch will be approximately 150 MiB.</p>
<p>This is a simple example; the actual size depends on a variety of factors, including the nature of the modifications. Use the AuthoringTool <a href="../Pages/Page_894619842.html">analyze-patch</a> command to check information about the differences between the initial version and the revised version of the application.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_323655382_h2_2">About Second and Subsequent Patches</h2>
<p>The size of a second (and subsequent) patch is the size of the difference from the initial version of the application. It is not the difference from the latest previous revision.<br />For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the case where 200 MiB of new files were added in the first revised version of the application</li>
  <li>Another 100 MiB was added in the second revised version of the application</li>
</ul>
<p>then</p>
<ul>
  <li>The size of the first patch would be approximately 200 MiB </li>
  <li>The size of the second patch would be 300 MiB; the cumulative amount of revisions to this point </li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>Additionally, if files are deleted between revised versions of an application, the patch size will decreased by that amount.<br />For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the case where 200 MiB of new files were added in the first revised version of the application</li>
  <li>100 MiB of previously added files were deleted in the second revised version of the application</li>
</ul>
<p>then</p>
<ul>
  <li>The size of the first patch would be approximately 200 MiB </li>
  <li>The size of the second patch would be approximately 100 MiB </li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is a simple example; the actual size depends on a variety of factors, including the nature of the modifications. You can use the AuthoringTool <a href="../Pages/Page_894619842.html">analyze-patch</a> command to check the information about the differences in files between patches.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_323655382_h1_2">How Do I Find the Size of a Data Download When Getting a Patch?</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_323655382_h2_3">When Getting a Patch for the First Time</h2>
<p>In the case of a console that has never received a patch, all of the latest patches will be downloaded.</p>
<p>You can use patch update analysis from the AuthoringTool <a href="../Pages/Page_894619842.html">analyze-patch</a> command to check the size when obtaining the patch. See the size that appears for <strong>update application to vX directly</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_323655382_h2_4">When Getting the Latest Patch of a Patch That Has Already Been Received</h2>
<p>In the case of a console that has already received a patch, in general, only the data in the latest patch that is different from the already received patch will be downloaded.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the case where 200 MiB of new files were added in the first revised version of the application</li>
  <li>Another 100 MiB were added in the second revised version of the application</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the patches are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>200 MiB for the first patch</li>
  <li>300 MiB for the second patch </li>
</ul>
<p>However, the sizes of the patches actually downloaded are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>200 MiB will be downloaded when getting the first patch</li>
  <li>100 MiB, the download size of the data that is different, will be downloaded when updating from the first patch to the second patch </li>
</ul>
<p>. This is a simple example; the actual size depends on a variety of factors, including the nature of the modifications.</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51); letter-spacing: 0.0px;">You can use patch update analysis from the AuthoringTool <a href="../Pages/Page_894619842.html">analyze-patch</a> command to check the size when updating a patch with the difference data. See the size that appears for <strong>update vX patch to vY by delta</strong>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51); letter-spacing: 0.0px;">In the following cases, rather than updating only the difference, the entire latest patch is downloaded.</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the already received patch is corrupted</li>
  <li>When a received patch has been deleted by the user</li>
  <li>When, at Nintendo&rsquo;s discretion, an update cannot be accomplished with only the difference</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_323655382_h1_3">What is the Maximum Patch Size That I Can Request?</h1>
<p>The maximum patch size that can be requested is stipulated in the guidelines.</p>
<p>This maximum size is the size of the patch generated by AuthoringTool, and is the size of the difference in updated data between the initial version of the application and the revised version. Note that this is not the size of the difference from the immediately prior revision.</p>
<p>For more information about the maximum size of specific patches, see the following sections in the Nintendo Switch Guidelines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limit on patch size</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_323655382_h1_4">What to Do When it Takes an Extended Time to Generate a Patch?</h1>
<p>Filenames included in the resource data are used as hints to speed up file searches. As a result, it can take an extended time to generate a patch if filenames or the locations where files are stored are changed in a revised version of an application.</p>
<p>Generating a patch can also take some time if the same data pattern appears in multiple locations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The same pattern exists in a repeating sound or image</li>
  <li>Files with the same contents are placed in multiple folders</li>
  <li>The same content is used in the file header or footer portion of numerous files</li>
</ul>
<p>The preceding cases are some situations where this could occur.</p>
<p>The following are possible countermeasures.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change filenames and file hierarchies as minimally as possible</li>
  <li>Devise data that makes it difficult for identical data patterns to occur</li>
</ul>
<p>If the data is difficult to work with, it may help to specify a value larger than 32 KiB (the default) with the <code>--minimum-matching-size</code> option of the <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool makepatch</a> command. However, note that there is a trade-off because improving the time taken to generate a patch also increases its size.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_323655382_h1_5">Unchanged Files Are Sometimes Included in a Patch</h1>
<p>If there is less than 32 KiB of unchanged files, they are sometimes included in a patch even though they were unchanged. (This size changes in connection with <code>--minimum-matching-size</code>.)</p>
<p>Use the AuthoringTool <a href="../Pages/Page_894619842.html">analyze-patch</a> command to check which files have revisions and are included in the patch. To also see small files, adjust the size specified by the filter.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_323655382_h1_6">Points to Check When a Patch is Larger Than Expected</h1>
<p>Check the following items if a patch size is larger than expected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The entire executable code portion is included in the patch, not just the differences.</li>
  <li>Our binary matching algorithm cannot detect any shifts smaller than 16 bytes. As a result, the resulting patch may be larger than expected if your data is not aligned to 16-byte boundaries. For more information about binary matching, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135554.html">Optimization Information</a>.</li>
  <li>This differs depending on whether each file was compressed and then archived, or each file was archived and then compressed. With the former, if the binary matching conditions are met, only the added and revised files are included in the patch as the difference. In the latter case, the entire compressed archive file is included in the patch as the difference. For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135554.html">Optimization Information</a>.</li>
  <li>A file may have been revised unintentionally and included in the patch. Use the AuthoringTool list <a href="../Pages/Page_894619842.html">analyze-patch</a> command to check information about differences between files included in a patch.</li>
