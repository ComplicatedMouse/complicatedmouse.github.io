<!-- Heartbeats Tab -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_758198867">Heartbeats Tab</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The&nbsp;<strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Heartbeats</strong>&nbsp;tab allows profile data to be framed against particular heartbeats per core. In addition, a&nbsp;subset of frames at a given rate can be quickly selected.</p>
<p>Heartbeat&nbsp;is the term used to describe a periodic rhythm on a particular core. Heartbeats can be directly logged using the profiler API or automatically inferred by the profiler by looking at functions that are periodically called. For example, a set of audio functions might be called every 3ms due to an audio interrupt or a set of AI functions might be called every 1/3 of a second to do some analysis. If the profiler automatically detects these heartbeats, they are known as <strong>Inferred Heartbeats</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198867_h1_1">Group Selection</h1>
<p>Group selection allows particular groups of frames to be selected according to their rate. The following&nbsp;table explains each button's action.</p>
<p>
  <strong>60Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running at 60 Hz or faster (16.6 ms or less).</p>
<p>
  <strong>30Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running between 30 Hz and 60 Hz (16.6 &ndash; 33.3 ms).</p>
<p>
  <strong>20Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running between 20 Hz and 30 Hz (33 &ndash; 50 ms).</p>
<p>
  <strong>15Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running between 15 Hz and 20 Hz (50 &ndash; 66.6 ms).</p>
<p>
  <strong>12Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running between 12 Hz and 15 Hz (66.6 &ndash; 83.3 ms).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Under 12Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running lower than 12 Hz (greater than 83.3 ms).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Under 30Hz:&nbsp;</strong>Select all frames on all cores running lower than 30 Hz (greater than 33.3 ms).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Invert:&nbsp;</strong>Invert frame selection (selected frames are deselected and unselected frames are selected).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Deselect All:&nbsp;</strong>All frames are deselected.</p>
<p>Selection of frames can be viewed in the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab. Note that all of the buttons can be toggled,&nbsp;except for <strong>Invert</strong> and <strong>Deselect All</strong>. If you toggle a particular button on, the corresponding frames that&nbsp;match the rate will be selected (highlighted in orange). Toggling a button off will deselect frames that match&nbsp;the rate. The toggling action allows you to select or deselect several ranges independently, for example&nbsp;allowing you to select frame rate ranges. You can manually override these group selections by directly&nbsp;selecting or deselecting individual frames within the <strong>Timeline</strong> using the <strong>Select Frames</strong> mode in the <strong>Timeline</strong> toolbar.</p>
<p>When frames are selected or deselected, all displayed values (for example percentages in the <strong>Functions&nbsp;</strong>tab) are recalculated to only include the selected frames. If no frames are selected, the entire data set is&nbsp;reflected in the values.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198867_h1_2">Heartbeat Selection</h1>
<p>There are a few selection boxes that are made available for framing data, depending on what data was recorded.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Frame Rate</strong>: Uses the selected heartbeat as the frame rate on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab. For the framerate, it is recommended that you record the <strong>MainHeartbeat</strong> (<span class="ApiLink_nn__profiler__Heartbeats_Main">nn::profiler::Heartbeats_Main</span>) in your game.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>CPU</strong>: Shows data on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab from the CPU according to the selected heartbeat. This value is also used when <strong>Avg Mode</strong> is selected in the&nbsp;<strong>Units Group</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>GPU</strong>: Shows data on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab from the GPU according to the selected heartbeat.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Audio</strong>: Shows data on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab from AudioRenderer according to the selected heartbeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>When profile data is received or loaded, all of the available heartbeats are filled into each of the available selectors and a default selection is made. There are three types of heartbeats that appear in the selectors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fixed intervals which do not correspond with anything in particular (<strong>Fixed 60Hz Intervals</strong>, <strong>Fixed 1ms Intervals</strong>).</li>
  <li>Heartbeats that your game recorded (for example <strong>Vsync</strong> gets logged automatically or you might have logged&nbsp;<strong>MainHeartbeat</strong>).</li>
  <li>Inferred heartbeats (periodic rhythms that were automatically detected in your game).</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixed intervals are offered in order to draw fixed time markers within the <strong>Timeline</strong>&nbsp;tab for that core. By&nbsp;design, they can't be used as frame boundaries or to select frames, since the game's profile data would&nbsp;never be in-sync with these fixed intervals and the resulting information would be misleading.</p>
<p>Recorded heartbeats and inferred heartbeats show useful frame markings on the <strong>Timeline</strong> that&nbsp;can then be used for further analysis or selection. For example, you can select all <strong>30Hz</strong> frames from the&nbsp;<strong>Group Selection</strong> ribbon bar group. Recorded heartbeats are manually logged in the game code using&nbsp;the functions as described in the API. Inferred heartbeats are automatically&nbsp;detected, based on periodic function behavior. However, if the sampling rate is too low or there are no&nbsp;detectable patterns, then there may not be any inferred heartbeats.</p>
<p>Note: Inferred heartbeats&nbsp;will have arbitrary frame boundaries based on the most periodic function detected, so it is unlikely that it&nbsp;will line up with the true beginning of your frame (we recommend that you deliberately record a heartbeat&nbsp;in your code if you want accurate frame boundaries). Lastly, inferred heartbeats are ordered from most&nbsp;represented in the profile to least represented, so pay more attention to inferred heartbeats that appear&nbsp;higher up within the drop down box.</p>
