<!-- Content Save Locations -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_832589756">Content Save Locations</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_832589756_h1_1">Overview</h1>
<p>This section describes the locations where content downloaded by the user is saved.<br />For more information about the locations where content is saved in the development environment, see <a href="../Pages/Page_424117414.html">Running and Controlling Applications</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_832589756_h1_2">Terminology Definitions for Content</h1>
<p>This page uses &quot;content&quot; as an overall term for the following three types of data.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Application</li>
  <li>Downloadable content</li>
  <li>Patches</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_832589756_h1_3">Content Save Locations</h1>
<p>You can currently use the system memory or microSD cards to save content data on the Switch system.<br />The user cannot select where the content is saved. If a microSD card is inserted into the Switch, the microSD card is prioritized as the destination for saving content. If there is not enough space on the microSD card to save the applicable content, it is saved in the system memory. However, this specification may change in the future.</p>
<p>For applications and patches, the preceding specifications might cause applications and patches to be saved in different locations. If a microSD card is inserted after an application was already downloaded to system memory, the patch data may be saved to the microSD card. As a result, there may be situations where the patch becomes unavailable when the microSD card is removed. However, due to the required version system, an application that has been started with the patch applied does not start without the patch. For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135488.html#Anchor_185135488_patch_deletion">Deleting Patches</a>.</p>
<p>There are also situations where multiple pieces of downloadable content are saved in the Switch. Based on the preceding specifications, these pieces of downloadable content may be saved either to system memory or to the microSD card.<br />In some cases the storage locations might be different, such as one piece of downloadable content being downloaded to system memory while another piece of downloadable content is saved to the microSD card. As a result, in some situations, removing the microSD card might cause some downloadable content to become unavailable.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_832589756_h1_4">Transferring Content</h1>
<p>In versions earlier than Firmware 10.0.0-4.0, it was not possible for the user to transfer content between the system memory and the microSD card.</p>
<p>In Firmware 10.0.0-4.0 and later, the user can transfer content between the system memory and the microSD card.<br />In this case, the application, downloadable content, and patch cannot be transferred individually. Instead, only transferring all content associated with the application together is supported.</p>
<p>You can transfer content from <strong>Data Management</strong> in <strong>System Settings</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_832589756_h1_5">Deleting Content</h1>
<p>Users cannot delete downloadable software, downloadable content, and patches individually. To delete the content, you must delete all content associated with that application.</p>
<p>To delete content, use <strong>Options</strong> in the HOME menu or <strong>Data Management</strong> in <strong>System Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Deleted content can be downloaded again from Nintendo eShop if the account that owns the license for that content is associated with the Switch.</p>
