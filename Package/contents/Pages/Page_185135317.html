<h1 id="Anchor_185135317_h1_1">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document is intended for game developers and covers the following topics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating Patches</li>
  <li>The workflow when developing a patch</li>
  <li>Reducing the size of the patch</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Patch Guide presents other information, such as descriptions of the user experience of NX patches and what kinds of revisions are possible. Also refer to that documentation.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135317_h1_2">Provided Features</h1>
<p>NX patches provide the following functionality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix bugs and add features to card-based applications that have already been released.</li>
  <li>Fix bugs and add features to downloadable applications that have already been released.</li>
  <li>Incorporate patches into game cards to manufacture the game cards with bug fixes (so-called <em>on-card</em> patches).</li>
</ul>
<p>For any of these applications, patches can make use of common parts.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_185135317_h2_1">Partial File Patch</h2>
<p>With NX patches, if only some files need revising, just those revised files can be incorporated in the patch.</p>
<p>On past platforms, if an archive with several files was created for fast loading, the patch had to incorporate the entire archive even if only some of the files needed revising. As a result, sometimes the patches were huge.</p>
<p>The NX system supports partial patches, so this problem does not arise very often. The trade-off is that there are a number of restrictions when using differences to incorporate the parts that need revising. For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135554.html">Optimization Information</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_185135317_h2_2">Patch Updates</h2>
<p>If multiple patches have been released, the update between patches corresponds to the difference in the amount of revision implemented in each. For example, if patch v1 is 100 MB and patch v2 is 110 MB and the difference in the amount of revision between patches is 20 MB, users who downloaded v1 only need to download that 20 MB. (This example is simple. The size of the download varies depending on the sizes of the patches and the content of the revisions.)</p>
<p>Developers do not need to pay close attention to the updating of patches.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135317_h1_3">Patches and File System Performance</h1>
<p>If a patch is applied to the application, the performance of the file system which the application references will change. For more information about what is affected, see <a href="../Pages/Page_211661819.html">Patches and Performance</a></p>
<p>Special care is required with Firmware for NX 1x because a bug makes the reading speed slower than expected.</p>
<p>If the change in performance of the file system affects the performance of the game, test the state in which the patch is applied.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135317_h1_4">SDK Versions That Can Develop Patches</h1>
<p>To create patches, you must migrate to NintendoSDK NX Add-On 1.0.0 or later.</p>
<p>However, the patches can be applied without problem to applications that were created using earlier versions of NintendoSDK.</p>
