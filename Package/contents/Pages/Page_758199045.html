  </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_758199045_h1_5">Module Statistics</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Module Statistics</strong>&nbsp;section shows the various modules that were seen during the profile. This is split&nbsp;into&nbsp;<strong>Recorded Modules</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Resolved Modules</strong>, and<strong>&nbsp;Module References</strong>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Recorded Modules</strong>&nbsp;are those relocatable modules that the profiler saw loaded and/or unloaded. For each&nbsp;recorded module there should an entry in the&nbsp;<strong>Resolved Modules</strong>&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Resolved Modules</strong>&nbsp;are the actual modules that were loaded into the profiler in order to resolve symbol&nbsp;address and names. For static modules there will be an entry in this list, but not in the recorded modules&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Module References</strong>&nbsp;are the references actually obtained from profiler before they move into&nbsp;<strong>Recorded Modules</strong>. These are now shown primarily for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<p>Each module listing shows the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the module.</li>
  <li>The path which the module was loaded from (only for&nbsp;<strong>Resolved Modules</strong>).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Base:</strong>&nbsp;The address at which the module was loaded into memory.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;The reported size of the module in memory (only for&nbsp;<strong>Recorded Modules&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Module References</strong>).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Functions:</strong>&nbsp;The number of functions loaded from the module (only for&nbsp;<strong>Resolved Modules</strong>).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lifetime:</strong>&nbsp;The times during which the module was loaded into memory in the format &quot;[time loaded, time&nbsp;unloaded]&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_758199045_h1_6">Inferred Heartbeats</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Inferred Heartbeats</strong>&nbsp;section shows any inferred heartbeats that were automatically detected while analyzing the profile&nbsp;data. The following information is provided per inferred heartbeat:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The core the inferred heartbeat was found on.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Period:</strong>&nbsp;The period at which the function was found to execute.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Variance:</strong>&nbsp;How close the function was to a consistent period.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Thread:</strong>&nbsp;The ID of the thread which the function was running on.</li>
  <li>The name of the function.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_758199045_h1_7">Application Information</h1>

If this is empty, then the data was not able to be obtained for the thread.</li><li><strong>Priority</strong>: The thread's priority. If this is empty, then the data was not able to obtained for the thread.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_758199045_h1_8">Power Information</h1>
<p>The Power Information section provides data gathered when Power Stats was enabled for profiling. A variety of information is recorded and displayed. Most of the values shown are averages followed by the minimum and maximum values seen during profiling.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Estimated Battery Life</strong>: The estimated amount of time in hours the application could run on battery power.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Temperatures</strong>: The internal and external temperatures.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Frequencies</strong>: The CPU, GPU, and EMC frequencies. In general, these values will not change during a profile.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>GPU Load</strong>: The load the GPU was under during the profile.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Watt Usage</strong>: A breakdown by component on where power is being used by the system.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_758199045_h1_9">Profiler Information</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Profiler Statistics</strong>&nbsp;section shows information about the profiler runtime that was used to record the data&nbsp;in the profile. While not directly useful most of the time, these values are useful when reporting problems&nbsp;seen with the profiler.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Profiler Version:</strong>&nbsp;The version of the profiler used to record the data.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Profiler Build Date/Time:</strong>&nbsp;The date and time that this version of the profiler library was built.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Profiler Build SDK:</strong>&nbsp;The SDK used to build the profiler.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_758199045_h1_10">Notes</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;text box at the bottom of the&nbsp;<strong>Info</strong>&nbsp;window&nbsp;allows you to store user notes with a profile. These notes&nbsp;are saved along with the profile when it is saved with the&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;button.&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;can only be added with a newly taken profile.</p>
<p>If there are no notes, the&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;section will be collapsed with only the header showing. To expand the&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;section, either click the up arrow on the right side of the&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;header or drag the&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;header&nbsp;upward with the mouse.</p>
