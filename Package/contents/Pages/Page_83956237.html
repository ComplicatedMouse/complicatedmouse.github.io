<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_1">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_1">About PC Emulation</h3>
<p>SoundMaker supports the PC emulation-based playback of sounds from computer audio output.<br />PC emulation runs as an independent program from the SoundMaker GUI, and enables the playback of instruments in the stream sounds, sequence sounds, wave sounds, and bank files of sound projects.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_2">Playing Instruments</h3>
<p>There are two ways to play instruments by using PC emulation.<br />The first is playback by using GUI operations where playback is performed from the bank window. This corresponds to &quot;Playback Information Route 1&quot; in the following conceptual diagram.<br />The second is playback based on MIDI signals from an external MIDI device. This corresponds to &quot;Playback Information Route 2&quot; in the conceptual diagram.</p>
<p>Note that completely different operations are performed under PC emulation for these two methods of playback.<br />GUI-based selection of instruments does not affect the playback of any particular MIDI channel.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956237_h4_1">Conceptual Diagram of PC Emulation</h4>
<p> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83956237/124258841.gif" width="300" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_2">GUI-Based Sound Playback</h2>
<p>You can play back sounds by using the graphical user interface (GUI) after making a selection in the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab.</p>
<p>For more information, see Sound Playback Operations.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_3">GUI-Based Instrument Playback</h2>
<p>You can play back instruments from the GUI by using the <strong>Bank</strong> tab.<br />When multiple <strong>Bank</strong> tabs are open, instruments always play from the active <strong>Bank</strong> tab.</p>
<p>The following section describes how to play instruments by using PC emulation in the <strong>Bank</strong> tab.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_3">Instrument List</h3>
<p>You can open this list by pressing the SPACEBAR, F9, and F10 on the computer keyboard.<br />Pressing and releasing the SPACEBAR corresponds to the <strong>note on</strong> and <strong>note off</strong> MIDI commands, respectively.<br />Press F9 to trigger playback and F10 to stop playback.<br />This is true of all playback performed in <strong>Bank</strong> tabs using the SPACEBAR, F9, and F10.<br />In the instrument list, pressing the SPACEBAR, F9, and F10 plays the key selected within the virtual keyboard in the <strong>Sample Map</strong> pane (usually <strong>C4</strong>) for the selected instrument.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_4">Sample Map</h3>
<p>To play back, click the keyboard shown in the GUI and press the SPACEBAR, F9, and F10 on the computer keyboard.<br />Click the virtual keyboard to play the key that corresponds to the instrument that you are editing.<br />The SPACEBAR and F9 are used for playback of a region.<br />The waveform of the region selected by key stroke will play using the original key for that region.</p>
<p>With the slider to the left of the keyboard, you can specify the velocity during playback through a keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_5">Percussion List</h3>
<p>You can open this list by pressing the SPACEBAR, F9, and F10 on the computer keyboard.<br />Pressing the SPACEBAR or F9 plays the key corresponding to the selected instrument being edited in the list.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_4">MIDI-Based Instrument Playback</h2>
<p>PC emulation functions as a 16-channel, multi-timbre sound source for MIDI input from the configured MIDI port.<br />Channels that produce sound from MIDI input support all instruments of the bank tab that is active in the channel. Switching between instruments is performed according to the program numbers set on the instrument list.</p>
<p>For each channel, make sure to specify a program number for the instrument to play at the MIDI program change.</p>
<p>For the selection of an instrument from the instrument list, the program changes of the corresponding instrument are sent only to MIDI channel 1.</p>
<p>Instruments from separate banks cannot be played simultaneously on multiple MIDI channels.<br />The bank is switched when the <strong>Bank</strong> tab becomes active.<br />Note that after a program number is specified for a channel, it is not reset even if the active <strong>Bank</strong> tab is switched.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_6">MIDI Playback</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Options</strong> dialog box to specify the devices that SoundMaker uses as the keyboard and the sequencer for MIDI input.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956237_h4_2">MIDI Playback From the Selected Keyboard</h4>
<p>This option is mostly used to check the instruments that are registered for a particular bank.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Bank</strong> tab is active, and an instrument within the instrument list is selected, MIDI signals from the selected keyboard are played back by using that instrument.<br />If a different instrument is then selected, the sound switches to that instrument.</p>
<p>Because the currently active instrument is used for playback, playback of MIDI signals from the selected keyboard requires that the <strong>Bank</strong> tab is active and that an instrument is active as well.   </p>
<p>Regardless of whether an instrument is selected, if a &quot;Program Change&quot; MIDI command is received from the keyboard, the instrument that corresponds to the new program is selected.<br />Incoming &quot;Bank Select&quot; commands are ignored.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956237_h4_3">MIDI Playback From the Selected Sequencer</h4>
<p>This is mostly used to incorporate MIDI data that was created with commercially available sequencing software into SoundMaker, and to check the corresponding banks.</p>
<p>MIDI is played back by using the banks that are registered in the Preview Bank pane.</p>
<p>You can set up to four banks for a sequence sound.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_5">Confirming the State of PC Emulation</h2>
<p>The upper-right part of the main window always shows two statuses associated with PC emulation: (1) MIDI Reception and (2) Actual Sound Production.</p>
<p>MIDI keyboard input produces only the sound for the active bank panel.<br />If the bank panel is not active, no sound is produced.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_7">Meanings of Displayed Items</h3>
<p>The following sections explain the displayed items.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956237_h4_4">MIDI</h4>
<p>  Lit green when PC emulation has received some kind of MIDI signal.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956237_h4_5">SOUND</h4>
<p>Lit green when PC emulation has sent some kind of sound output.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_8">Display Updates</h3>
<p>The displayed information is updated every 1/30 of a second.<br />Accordingly, it may not be possible to confirm the output of extremely brief sounds.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_6">Stop All Channels</h2>
<p>During PC emulation you can forcibly stop all sounds being played back by selecting <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Stop all channels</strong>.</p>
<p>Use this feature when you want to stop the playback of an instrument that has an extremely long release time that was set by using an envelope.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_7">MIDI Reset</h2>
<p>To reset all PC emulation MIDI parameters, select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>MIDI reset</strong>.<br />This operation resets all parameters such as volume that were specified previously by external MIDI input.</p>
<p>Use this feature when you play another MIDI sequence under PC emulation, when you play a MIDI sequence from a midway point, or when you do not want to keep the settings for parameters that are based on MIDI messages such as control change.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956237_h2_8">Cautions and Supplemental Notes</h2>
<p>This page provides cautions and other information that is useful during PC emulation.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_9">Using PC Emulation From Sequencers Running on the Same Computer</h3>
<p>To perform PC emulation playback by using the MIDI output of sequencers that run on the same computer that runs SoundMaker, it is necessary to loop the MIDI output from the sequencer back into the MIDI input of the computer.</p>
<p>Looping back a MIDI signal in this manner is called <em>loopback</em>. Loopback can be accomplished in the software by using a freeware virtual MIDI device driver.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956237_h3_10">Reproducibility of Sounds Using PC Emulation</h3>
<p>When you play sounds using PC emulation, you cannot re-create the degradation of audio quality due to compression of ADPCM and other waveform data, nor the characteristics of the platform-specific audio circuits.<br />Consequently, the sound quality of the output can differ on some platforms.</p>
<p>As with MIDI, PC emulation does not support theoretically impossible playback such as loops or sequence command playback.</p>
<p>Be sure to perform final testing of each sound using the platform consoles.</p>
