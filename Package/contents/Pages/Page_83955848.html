<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_83955848">Wave Sounds</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_83955848_h1_1">Wave Sounds</h1>
<p>Select the <strong>Wave Sound</strong> node in the project tree to show a list of the wave sounds on the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab.<br />The list is split and displayed in upper and lower sections on the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab.<br />The upper part of this split tab is called the <strong>Wave Sound Set List</strong>, and the lower part is called the <strong>Wave Sound List</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955848_h2_1">Role of Wave Sound Sets</h2>
<p>Wave sounds are played by loading the referenced waveform data into memory.<br />The main use of wave sounds is for sound effects, which require an extremely large variety of wave sounds. It would be inefficient to load all of these wave sounds individually into memory.<br />The <strong>Wave Sound Set</strong> defines a combination of waveform data that can be loaded into memory all at the same time.<br />Usually, a set of waveform data for sound effects is collected together for each scene and loaded into memory. Sound data that assumes this approach to the loading of waveform data can be created by using a <strong>Wave Sound Set</strong> to efficiently gather together the effect sounds (wave sounds) to use in a particular scene.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955848_h2_2">Creating and Adding Wave Sound Sets</h2>
<p>To create or add a wave sound set, on the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab, select the list, and then select <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Item</strong> &gt; <strong>Wave Sound Set</strong>.</p>
<p>To create or add a wave sound set, right-click the <strong>Wave Sound Set</strong> list and use the shortcut menu.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955848_h2_3">Elements of a Wave Sound Set List</h2>
<p>This section describes the meaning of each of the elements that define a <strong>Wave Sound Set List</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_1">Name</h3>
<p>Specifies the name of the <strong>Wave Sound Set</strong>.<br />The characters that can be used in a name are restricted. The following characters can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9_] for subsequent characters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_2">Waveform Archive</h3>
<p>Used to configure which waveform archive a bank is associated with. In other words, the waveform archive element chooses the waveform archive that you want to share.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic (Shared)<br />Generates a waveform archive <strong>automatically</strong>.<br />The other wave sound sets and bank waveform archives in the same embedding group are also collected <strong>all together</strong>.<br />(Generates a single waveform archive containing all the waveforms used within the embedding group.)<br />The waveform data of a waveform archive cannot be loaded <strong>individually</strong>. The data is loaded <strong>all together</strong> at the same time.</li>
  <li>Automatic (Separate)<br />Generates a waveform archive <strong>automatically</strong>.<br />However, waveform archives, even though they belong to the group with the other wave sound sets and banks, are not collected together with them.<br />Waveform archives that are configured with this setting are not shared with any other banks. Such archives are loaded <strong>all together</strong>.</li>
  <li>Specify waveform archives explicitly.<br />You can specify whether the waveform files within a waveform archive are loaded <strong>individually</strong> or <strong>all together</strong>.<br />However, even if a waveform archive is set to load <strong>individually</strong>, it is loaded <strong>all together</strong> with the other waveform archives if the output method for the group is set to <strong>Embed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about using waveform archives in combination with output methods, see Waveform Archive Automatic (Shared, Separate) Settings.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955848_h2_4">Creating and Adding Wave Sounds</h2>
<p>To create or add a wave sound, first select the <strong>Wave Sound List</strong> that you want to add the wave sound to by using the <strong>Wave Sound Set List</strong>.<br />Next, select <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Item</strong> &gt; <strong>Wave Sound</strong>.</p>
<p>To create or add a wave sound, right-click the <strong>Wave Sound List</strong> and use the shortcut menu.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955848_h2_5">Editing Wave Sounds</h2>
<p>Wave sounds are edited by using the <strong>Wave Sound List</strong>.<br />Representing the elements that are required when defining a wave sound, each column in the <strong>Wave Sound List</strong> corresponds to an element that is required by the wave sound data in a sound archive.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955848_h2_6">Elements of a Wave Sound List</h2>
<p>This section describes the meaning of each of the elements that define a <strong>Wave Sound List</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_3">Play</h3>
<p>Clicking this button registers the selected sound in the Preview Player window, and triggers playback of the wave sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_4">Name</h3>
<p>Specifies the name of the wave sound. This name is for the wave sound that the program plays with the Atk library from the ultimately created sound archive.</p>
<p>The characters that can be used in a name are restricted. The following characters can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9_] for subsequent characters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_5">Compression Format</h3>
<p>Specifies the compression format that is used by the converter to convert reference waveform files.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ADPCM</strong>  Converts the waveform file to the proprietary ADPCM format.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>PCM16</strong>  Converts the file to 16-bit PCM data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_6">File path</h3>
<p>Specifies the wave file to reference when creating a wave sound.</p>
<p>The characters that can be used in a filename or path name are restricted. The following characters can be used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character of the filename.</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _] for subsequent characters in the filename.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_7">Playback time</h3>
<p>Displays the playback time for sounds (the length of the waveform data expressed as time).<br />The units are displayed in <em>mm:ss. ms</em> and the value in milliseconds are rounded to the second digit.</p>
<p>For looped waveform data, this shows the time to the end of the loop, not the length of the waveform itself.<br />In addition, an <strong>L</strong> is displayed at the front of the cell.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_8">Downsampling</h3>
<p>Specifies whether downsampling is enabled or disabled.</p>
<p>You can downsample and include waveform files in the sound archive, using the value specified as the sample rate, without changing that original waveform file, when this option is enabled.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_9">Sample Rate</h3>
<p>Displays the sample rate of the waveform file when downsampling is disabled.</p>
<p>The downsampling value can be specified in a range from 2,000 to 192,000 Hz when downsampling is enabled.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_10">Bit Rate</h3>
<p>Displays the bit rate of the waveform file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_11">Number of Quantization Bits</h3>
<p>Displays the quantifying bit number of the waveform file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_12">Number of Channels</h3>
<p>If there are one or two waveform channels, either <strong>Mono</strong> or <strong>Stereo</strong> appears.<br />If there are three or more channels, just the number of channels appears.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_13">Downmixing</h3>
<p>This feature enables and disables downmixing.</p>
<p>When enabled, this feature downmixes stereo into mono without changing the original waveform, and includes it in the sound archive.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_14">Data Size</h3>
<p>Shows the size of the waveform data after compression and conversion.<br />The content on display is updated when files are converted.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_15">Volume</h3>
<p>Specifies the volume (in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>) to use when the Atk library plays the wave sound.</p>
<p>If sound data volume is set to <code>127</code>, playback is at the same volume (1.0 times) as the source data.</p>
<p>However, volume can be set in many ways (data or program).<br />The result after all setting values are applied is clamped between 0.0 times and 2.0 times the source volume.</p>
<p>For more information, see Sound Parameter Control Operations in the <em><a href="../Pages/Page_83955829.html">Sound System Manual</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_16">Average Loudness Value</h3>
<p>To display the average loudness value, you can right-click an item and select <strong>Measure average loudness value</strong> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_17">Channel Priority</h3>
<p>Specifies the channel priority of the wave sound as a value from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>.<br />The higher the value, the higher the priority.</p>
<p>Channel priority is used as the voice priority passed to the AX library when a wave sound is actually voiced.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_18">Player Priority</h3>
<p>Specifies the player priority of the wave sound as a value from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>.<br />The higher the value, the higher the priority.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Player Priority</strong> indicates which sounds to play (or stop) when the player attempts to play more than its sound limit, or more than the maximum number of sounds and tracks as configured in the system settings.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956106.html">Sound System Manual</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_19">Player</h3>
<p>Specifies the player to use when voicing a wave sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_20">Actor Players</h3>
<p>The values <code>0</code> through <code>3</code> represent the four types of actor players to play.</p>
<p>Because actor players correspond to a real-world sound source or, specifically, the vocal chords of a particular voice, you can limit the number of sounds that can be played at the same time for each actor player.<br />Just as with a player, if the specified number of sounds is exceeded, the player priority set for each sound is compared, and the sound with the lowest priority is stopped.<br />The initial value of the number of restricted sounds for each actor player is unlimited for actor player number <code>0</code>, and <code>1</code> for actor player numbers <code>1</code> through <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Actor players are mainly used in conjunction with 3D sound actors.<br />As an example, use actor players when you want to suppress the playback of a sound at the actor level in situations where the same sound might be played simultaneously by multiple 3D sound actors.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_21">Single Playback</h3>
<p>Specifies the control mode for single playback.</p>
<p>Use <strong>Single playback</strong> to control playback so only one instance of a particular sound is played at the same time on the same player. You can specify any of the five following modes as the control method to control what happens when a particular sound is playing and the same sound plays once.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do nothing (the default)<br />The playing instance of the sound and the new instance of the sound both play.</li>
  <li>Last note priority<br />The playing sound stops and the new instance of the sound plays.</li>
  <li>Last note within time priority<br />The same controls as those from <strong>Last note priority</strong> are applied if the time that has elapsed since the start of the first sound falls within the period specified in the <strong>Single playback time</strong> column. Controls are same as when single playback is not used when outside the time.</li>
  <li>First note priority<br />The playing sound continues to play and the new instance of the sound fails to play.</li>
  <li>First note within time priority<br />The same controls as those from <strong>First note priority</strong> are applied if the time that has elapsed since the start of the first sound falls within the period specified in the <strong>Single playback time</strong> column. Controls are same as when single playback is not used when outside the time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_22">Single Playback Time</h3>
<p>If either <strong>Last note within time priority</strong> or <strong>First note within time priority</strong> has been specified as the control mode, this option is used to specify, in milliseconds, the duration of time to enable control over single playback.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_23">Pan</h3>
<p>Specifies the pan (in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>) to use when the Atk library plays the wave sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_24">S Pan</h3>
<p>Specifies the surround pan (in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>) when <code>SoundLib</code> plays wave sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_25">Pitch</h3>
<p>Specifies the pitch (as a scaling factor) to use when the Atk library plays the wave sound.</p>
<p>You cannot enter a number smaller than <code>0.00001</code>. When batch editing files, values less than <code>0.00001</code> are corrected to <code>0.00001</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_26">LPF</h3>
<p>Specifies a value in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>64</code> for the cutoff frequency for the low pass filter.<br />If <code>64</code> is the center (where the filter is not effective), the closer to <code>0</code>, the more the filter is in play.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Values are effective only for moving downward from the center (where the filter is applied).</p>
<p>The LPF and biquad filter can be used together, and the effects are combined when both are used together.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_27">Biquad Filter Type</h3>
<p>Specifies the <code>biquad</code> filter type.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not in use (default value)</li>
  <li>LPF (low-pass filter)</li>
  <li>HPF (high-pass filter)</li>
  <li>BPF (center frequency of 512 Hz) (band-pass filter)</li>
  <li>BPF (center frequency of 1024 Hz)</li>
  <li>BPF (center frequency of 2048Hz)</li>
  <li>User-defined filter (64 types)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_28">Biquad Filter Value</h3>
<p>Specifies a value in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code> for the effect of the <code>biquad</code> filter.<br />There is no effect when the value is <code>0</code>, and the effect is at maximum when the value is <code>127</code>.</p>
<p>The LPF and biquad filter can be used together, and the effects are combined when both are used together.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_29">Env R</h3>
<p>Specifies the release time of the release envelope as a value from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955848_h3_30">Send AUX_A</h3>
