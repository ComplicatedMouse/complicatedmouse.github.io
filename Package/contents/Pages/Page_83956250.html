<h1 id="Anchor_83956250_h1_1">Nodes</h1>
<p>In this manual, the term <em>node</em> refers to the basic unit for the hierarchical structure of a 3D model.</p>
<p>In 3ds Max, nodes correspond to such objects as standard primitives, dummies, and bones.</p>
<p>3ds Max nodes are exported as bones in model intermediate files.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956250_h2_1">Node Names</h2>
<p>Although you can assign the same name to multiple nodes with 3ds Max, make sure that you assign a unique name to each node because there is no overlap of node names in the intermediate file.</p>
<p>If multiple nodes with the same name exist, the Export plug-in exports the first node that it fetches with the existing name, and then alters the name of each subsequent node by adding the underscore symbol and a number. (For example, <em>name</em><strong>_01</strong>, <em>name</em><strong>_02</strong>, and so on.)<br /> The user cannot check or change the order in which numbers and nodes are exported by name.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>This order of export may change depending on the version of the DCC tool, or the environment.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956250_h2_2">Root Nodes</h2>
<p>The intermediate file contains only one root bone for each skeletal model.</p>
<p>If there are multiple root nodes on 3ds Max, the plug-in will group them together and add them for export to the intermediate file as a single bone with the name <strong>nw4f_root</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956250_h2_3">Node Scale and Inheritance</h2>
<p>The plug-in supports scaling only in the general local coordinate system.</p>
<p>The following 3ds Max features are not supported.<br /> Note that if your model includes these features, the appearance differs slightly between 3ds Max and NintendoWare.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no support for non-local scaling (that is, world and view).</li>
  <li>There is no support to turn off inheritance of Translate, Rotate and Scale from the parent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956250_h2_4">Nodes Not Exported</h2>
<p>Cameras, lights and the targets they point at are not exported. Nodes having any of these as parents are also not exported.<br /> The hierarchical structure of nodes not displayed by 3ds Max is exported but not the mesh.<br /> Nodes and helpers that cannot be converted to meshes such as shapes, are output as meshless nodes.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Nodes whose compression enable flag has been set using the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955850.html">plug-in for not compressing nodes</a> will always be exported, regardless of these conditions.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956250_h2_5">Base Point</h2>
<p>When the data are exported, the base point is treated as the origin in local coordinates.</p>
<p>Note that the position of the 3ds Max base point as it appears on 3ds Max does not always match its internal position.<br /> If you have rotated or moved the base point, confirm the position by selecting <strong>Utilities</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset Xform</strong>.<br /> If you do not reset Xform this way, the internal position of the base point is taken to be its position when <strong>Reset Pivot</strong> was performed.</p>
