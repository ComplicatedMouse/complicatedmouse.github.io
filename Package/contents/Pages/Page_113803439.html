<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_1">Operation is not assured when the system locale is changed to anything other than the default value.</h1>
<p>The operation when the system locale is changed to anything other than the default value is not assured. (For example, if the locale is set to anything other than &quot;Japanese [Japan]&quot; in the Japanese version of Windows.)</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_2">Bugs Related to Visual Studio Help</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_1">If you try to uninstall the Documents package after uninstalling Visual Studio but with the Microsoft Help Viewer still installed, the uninstall will fail.</h2>
<p>If you try to uninstall the Nintendo SDK Documents package after uninstalling Visual Studio (any version) but with the Microsoft Help Viewer still installed, the uninstall will fail.</p>
<p>Uninstall Microsoft Help Viewer first, and then uninstall the package.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_2">The Find Result page for the NintendoSDK API Reference Manual does not work correctly in the Microsoft Help Viewer.</h2>
<p>The Find Result page for the NintendoSDK API Reference Manual does not work correctly in the Microsoft Help Viewer. If you try to use it, you cannot enter anything in the text box, making search impossible.</p>
<p>Use a web browser to use the Find Result page.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_3">HTCS Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_3">When htcs::Initialize is called while Target Manager is not running, the function is blocked until a connection with Target Manager is established.</h2>
<p>When <code>htcs::Initialize</code> is called while Target Manager is not running, the function is blocked until a connection with Target Manager is established.</p>
<p>We plan to change this function in the future, so that the call is successful regardless of the connection status with Target Manager. </p>
<p>This bug prevents the following applications from starting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>EffectViewer</li>
  <li>LayoutViewer</li>
  <li>VfxCustomShader Sample</li>
  <li>G3dDemo Sample Edit Demo</li>
  <li>AtkViewer Sample</li>
  <li>NintendoWare AtkPlayer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_4">It is handled as successful if the specified socket is closed during blocking by htcs::Accept.</h2>
<p>If the socket specified in <code>htcs::Accept</code> is closed when calling and blocking by <code>htcs::Accept</code>, it is successful even though normally <code>-1</code> is returned and failure is correct.</p>
<p>This problem will be corrected in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_5">An assertion failure occurs if the application is terminated without calling htcs::Finalize in the Develop build.</h2>
<p>There is a bug where an assertion is raised when terminating an application without calling <code>htcs::Finalize</code> after <code>htcs::Initialize</code> in the Develop build of the application.</p>
<p>This problem will be corrected in a future release.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_4">audio Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_6">Exporting sound waveforms does not work in NintendoWare SoundMaker and SoundProjectWaveExporter.</h2>
<p>Attempts to export sound waveforms using the NintendoWare tools SoundMaker and SoundProjectWaveExporter always result in the creation of blank waveform files.</p>
<p>This problem will be corrected in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_7">When you convert a sound project imported using NintendoWare's SoundMaker, an invalid sound archive is exported.</h2>
<p>When, in SoundMaker, an NW4C/NW4F sound project (one for which the cache file remains for converting purposes) is imported and (normally) converted, NW4C/NW4F binary source files become mixed in with the NintendoSDK binary sound archive (BFSAR) files. As a result, they cannot be correctly read during the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> and <code>nw::snd</code> runtimes. This is a problem.</p>
<p> As a workaround to this problem, make sure to reconvert the sound project after importing it. This conversion makes the old cache file unusable.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_8">Some of the APIs for nn::atk do not work. </h2>
<p>
  <strong>APIs related to LowPassFilter do not work.</strong>
</p>
<p>APIs related to <code>LowPassFilter</code>, such as <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundHandle__SetLowPassFilterFrequency">nn::atk::SoundHandle::SetLowPassFilterFrequency</span>()</code>, can currently be set, but they are not applied.<br /><br />The <code>LowPassFilter</code> value set in SoundMaker is not applied either.<br /><code>BiquadFilter</code> can still be used, as before.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_9">If some of the parameters in Biquad filter are set, the audio may be cut off.</h2>
<p>If the following parameters are set in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundHandle__SetBiquadFilter">nn::atk::SoundHandle::SetBiquadFilter</span>()</code> or <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundPlayer__SetBiquadFilter">nn::atk::SoundPlayer::SetBiquadFilter</span>()</code>, audio from some sources may be cut off.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the filter in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__BiquadFilterType_LowPassFilter">nn::atk::BiquadFilterType_LowPassFilter</span></code> is selected and the value is set to <code>1.0</code></li>
  <li>When the filter in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__BiquadFilterType_HighPassFilter">nn::atk::BiquadFilterType_HighPassFilter</span></code> is selected and the value is set to <code>0.1</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_10">When playing sounds in NintendoWare AtkPlayer from NintendoWare SoundMaker, the StartOffset values in the SoundParameters panel are not applied.</h2>
<p>When you connect SoundMaker and AtkPlayer and play sounds from SoundMaker in AtkPlayer, the StartOffset values in the AtkPlayer's SoundParameters panel are not applied.</p>
<p>For example, if the StartOffset value is set at 1,000 and sounds are played in AtkPlayer, they are played after one second, but when sounds are played from SoundMaker under the same conditions, the sounds are played from the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_11">Sometimes effects are not processed in the order they were added in nn::audio.</h2>
<p>The intended specification is for effects to be processed in the order in which they were added to <code>SubMix</code> or <code>FinalMix</code>. However, if you have two or more effects registered to a single <code>SubMix</code> or <code>FinalMix</code>, and you then delete an effect and add another new effect, the effects sometimes run in the wrong order.</p>
<p>You can avoid this problem by deleting all effects from <code>SubMix</code> and <code>FinalMix</code> and then adding the effects.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_12">An exception is thrown when the necessary voices cannot be allocated when playing stream sounds.</h2>
<p>An exception is thrown when the necessary voices cannot be allocated to play stream sounds and the program stops.</p>
<p>For example, the problem is reproduced if <code>SoundSystem::SoundSystemParam::<em>voiceCountMax</em></code> is specified as <code>1</code> and<br />stream sounds on channel 2 or higher are played.</p>
<p>This problem<br />can be worked around by setting a value equal to or higher than the total number of stream sound channels planned to be played at the same time in <code>SoundSystem::SoundSystemParam::<em>voiceCountMax</em></code>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_5">hid Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_13">An exception is thrown when the USB gamepad is detached during use in the Windows 8.1 environment.</h2>
<p>When the USB GamePad is removed during use in the Windows 8.1 environment, an exception is thrown and the program may stop.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_14">Accurate speed cannot be calculated for touching using Windows Touch Messages.</h2>
<p>When functions such as <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__hid__GetTouchScreenState">nn::hid::GetTouchScreenState</span>()</code> read the touch status using Windows Touch Messages, the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__hid__TouchState__deltaTime">nn::hid::TouchState::deltaTime</span></code> value does not consider the report rate and becomes a simple sampling interval.</p>
<p>Based on this, if the touch moving speed is calculated using this value, a value around the actual speed may be obtained as a result.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_6">ui2d Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_15">Alpha Test does not work.</h2>
<p>Alpha Test does not work in this package.</p>
<p>This problem is expected to be fixed by the next release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_16">Texture display cannot be performed correctly for LayoutViewer in some graphics driver environments.</h2>
<p>In some graphics driver environments, the textures in LayoutViewer are not displayed correctly. (We have seen this bug in the Quadro2000 driver 341.05 environment.)</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_7">3D Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_17">The G3dDemo Edit demo does not display correctly in the Visual Studio 2013 Release/Develop build.</h2>
<p>When you run the G3dDemo Edit demo in the Visual Studio 2013 Win32/x64 Release/Develop build, the aspect ratio is not calculated correctly when rendering and the demo display may be corrupted.</p>
<p>Either set the compiler optimization options in the Visual Studio project file properties to disabled (<code>/Od</code>), or build in something other than Visual Studio 2013 Release build.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_18">Material animation files output by NintendoWare 3D tool have the same name.</h2>
<p>The NintendoWare <a href="../Pages/Page_83955997.html">3D Binary Converter</a> has restrictions against converting shader parameter animations (FSP files), texture pattern animations (FTP files), texture SRT animations (FTS files), material visibility animations (FVM files), or color animations (FCL files) with the same name simultaneously. However, the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955629.html">Maya Export Plug-In</a> and <a href="../Pages/Page_83955545.html">3dsMax Export Plug-In</a> export intermediate files with the same name as the models.</p>
<p>Also, when creating a new animation for a model from <a href="../Pages/Page_83955978.html">3DEditor</a>, the default name is the same as the model.</p>
<p>When collecting these animation files with the same name into one binary file for conversion, change the names of the intermediate files before converting.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_19">If a texture pattern animation adds or deletes a bound model sampler in 3DEditor while the application is connected, an assertion failure occurs when the animation is unbound.</h2>
<p>If a texture pattern animation adds or deletes a bound model sampler in 3DEditor while 3DEditor and the application are connected, an assertion failure occurs when the animation is unbound.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_113803439_h2_20">A dialog box requesting that NDI shut down might be displayed when installing the Thumbnail Explorer Extension package.</h2>
<p>If a folder selection dialog box is displayed using the Nintendo Dev Interface when installing the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955701.html">Thumbnail Explorer Extension</a> package, a dialog box requesting that the tool be shut down might be displayed. If you shut the tool down, it becomes impossible to continue installation processing correctly. Click <strong>Cancel</strong> in the dialog box.</p>
<p>You can work around this problem by restarting the Nintendo Dev Interface and installing the package without displaying the folder selection dialog box.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_8">socket Bugs</h1>
<h3 id="Anchor_113803439_h3_1">Failure in nn::socket::Bind()</h3>
<p>If you call <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__socket__Bind">nn::socket::Bind</span>()</code> in a Windows environment, it fails and returns <code>EAFNOSUPPORT</code>.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in the next release.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_113803439_h3_2">Cannot use nn::socket::RecvFrom() in asynchronous mode.</h3>
<p>In a Windows environment, because the <code>MSG_DONTWAIT</code> flag is undefined, <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__socket__RecvFrom">nn::socket::RecvFrom</span>()</code> cannot be used in asynchronous mode.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_113803439_h3_3">Cannot link nn::socket::GetAddrInfo() (cannot use).</h3>
<p>In a Windows environment, the linker cannot reference <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__socket__GetAddrInfo">nn::socket::GetAddrInfo</span>()</code> at build time and building is not possible.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in the next release.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_9">The alphabet list is not displayed correctly in functions such as API references.</h1>
<p>In API references, under <strong>Namespace</strong> &gt; <strong>Namespace Members</strong>, the alphabet lists displayed under <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Functions</strong>, and <strong>Enumerated Values</strong> do not display the correct lists when selected.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_10">Jumping to change log details does not work.</h1>
<p>In the change log list, when you try to click each history to jump to the details, it may jump to the wrong location.</p>
<p>This problem does not occur with Internet Explorer.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_11">Sample demo batch processing fails when () is included in the path for the NintendoSDK.</h1>
<p>Batch processing fails when building the sample demo that performs batch processing if <code>()</code> is included in the path to the NintendoSDK. You can avoid this problem by not using <code>()</code> in the NintendoSDK path.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_113803439_h1_12">Sometimes there is no response when deleting an environment in Nintendo Dev Interface.</h1>
<p>When the separately installed Nintendo TargetManager is running, environment deletion processing may stop running.</p>
<p>You can avoid this problem by closing Nintendo TargetManager.</p>
