<!-- Initialization for PROD MODE, the Firmware That Approximates Retail Hardware -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_186060673">Initialization for PROD MODE, the Firmware That Approximates Retail Hardware</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_186060673_h1_1">Introduction</h1>
<p>This page describes the procedure to initialize using PROD MODE, the firmware for development hardware that approximates the retail hardware.</p>
<p>Later information will describe procedures for testing applications using this PROD MODE.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_186060673_h2_1">What Is PROD MODE, the Firmware That Approximates Retail Hardware?</h2>
<p>Differences in the internal structure for the development and retail hardware result in differences in application operations. Using PROD MODE, the firmware that approximates the retail hardware, enables you to create a state that approximates the operating settings for retail hardware, to reduce the differences that could appear when verifying software on development hardware.</p>
<p>Use this PROD MODE as a testing environment before submitting a master ROM for your developed application.</p>
<div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;">
  <div class="panelContent">
    <p>Use of this firmware not only approximates operations on retail hardware but also restricts some of the functionality available for the development hardware.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cannot connect to the console from Target Manager.</li>
      <li>Cannot use the debugger.</li>
      <li>Cannot use the <code>htc</code> library.</li>
      <li>On the EDEV, you must enter Safe Mode manually when reinitializing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information about restricted functions, see <a href="../Pages/Page_313339316.html">PROD MODE Restricted Functions</a>.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>You can also use firmware that approximates the retail hardware with the feature to save logs to a microSD memory card. This firmware is PROD MODE (described earlier) with the feature to save logs to a microSD memory card. You can use this to investigate bugs that only occur in PROD MODE. For example, some issues occur when using HostFS or the <code>htc</code> library with PROD MODE.</p>
<p>Initialization using these firmware versions is possible with the various initialization tools: <code>InitializeSdev</code>, <code>InitializeSdevWin</code>, <code>InitializeEdev</code>, and <code>InitializeEdevWin</code>.</p>

  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>In PROD MODE, the development hardware operates only in the HOME Menu environment.<br />In DEV MODE, which is described later, you can switch the development hardware between the HOME Menu environment and the DevMenu environment.</p>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_310879077.html">Development Assistance Settings</a> &gt; <a href="../Pages/Page_310879077.html#Anchor_310879077_initial-boot-menu">Initial Boot Menu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_186060673_h2_2">PROD MODE Is the Opposite of DEV MODE</h2>
<p>Unlike PROD MODE, which approximates the retail hardware, DEV MODE is firmware specific to the development hardware and is the firmware that is used by default.</p>
<p>If no specific firmware is specified for the initialization tool, the development hardware will be initialized with the DEV MODE firmware.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_186060673_h1_2">Initializing</h1>
<p>This description assumes that the procedures in the Development Hardware Setup/Firmware Update section of <a href="../Pages/Page_89997371.html">Guide to Setting Up the Environment</a> have been completed. If they have not been completed, see that document.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_186060673_h2_3">For the SDEV</h2>
<p>Start <code>InitializeSdev.bat</code> as you would normally.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_186060673/193066145.png" height="250" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>To initialize the development hardware with the PROD MODE firmware that approximates the retail hardware, select the option that includes <strong>+ Prod</strong> in the <strong>Select firmware variation</strong> combo box, and then click <strong>Start initialization</strong>. (This example selects the <strong>0.8.16-0 + Prod</strong> option to select the proper firmware.)</p>
<p>To use the version of PROD MODE with the feature to save logs to a microSD card, select the option that includes <strong>+ ProdWithLog</strong> in the <strong>Select firmware variation</strong> combo box, and then click <strong>Start initialization</strong>.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
      <p>To initialize the development hardware using the command-line tool (<code>InitializeSdev.exe</code>), specify the <code>--target-version</code> option when running the tool, as follows.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">$ InitializeSdev.exe --target XAW0213100XXXX --target-version &quot;0.8.16-0 + Prod&quot;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_186060673_h2_4">For the EDEV</h2>
<p>Start <code>InitializeEdev.bat</code>.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_186060673/193066161.png" height="250" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>In the <strong>Select firmware variation</strong> combo box, select the desired firmware and then click the <strong>Start initialization</strong> button.</p>
<p>To use the PROD MODE firmware that approximates the retail hardware, select the option that includes <strong>+ Prod</strong>. To use the version of PROD MODE with the feature to save logs to a microSD card, select <strong>+ ProdWithLog</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also specify the firmware, as was the case for SDEV, from <code>InitializeEdev.exe</code>, the command line initialization tool.</p>
<p>
  <u>
    <strong>
      <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">There is one area that requires additional considerations for EDEV! You must manually enter Safe Mode to reinitialize an EDEV if you have initialized it using PROD MODE.</span>
    </strong>
  </u>
  <br />For more information about the procedure for manually entering safe mode, see Manually Activating Safe Mode in <a href="../Pages/Page_159244488.html">When EDEV Initialization Fails</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_186060673_h1_3">Updating</h1>
<p>You can update to PROD MODE using an update tool such as <a href="../Pages/Page_206967126.html">SystemUpdateSdev</a>. However, be aware of the following.</p>
<p align="left">
  <u>
    <strong>
      <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">When updating from DEV MODE, the update tool will not result in an appropriate state, even though an update to PROD MODE occurs.</span>
    </strong>
  </u> This occurs as of NX Add-On 4.3.0.<br /><u><strong><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">When using the update tool to change to PROD MODE, you must also switch to PROD MODE before updating, using the update tool after switching.</span></strong></u></p>
<p>When updating from DEV MODE, the menu will remain as DevMenu without becoming HomeMenu. You can switch the menu if that occurs by using <code>DevMenuCommand -- debug switch-menu homemenu</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_186060673_h1_4">Testing Applications</h1>
<p>Certain steps are needed to test applications because you cannot use Target Manager with PROD MODE.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run applications in PROD MODE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Running as an application written to a game card.</li>
  <li>Running as an Installed Application</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_186060673_h2_5">Testing Applications Written to Game Cards</h2>
<p>The following procedure is needed to test applications written to game cards when using a PROD MODE console.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initialize the development hardware with the usual initialization method.</li>
  <li>Use DevMenuCommand to write an NSP file for an application to a game card.</li>
  <li>Initialize the development hardware in PROD MODE.</li>
  <li>Insert the game card and start the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot run DevMenuCommand on a PROD MODE console because DevMenuCommand uses TargetManager.</p>
<p>This method requires as many game cards as you have hardware to use for testing. If there are not a lot of game cards available, consider this approach: Running as an Installed Application.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_186060673_h2_6">Running as an Installed Application</h2>
<p>The following procedure is needed to run an application installed using PROD MODE.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initialize the development hardware with the usual initialization method.</li>
  <li>Insert the application's NSP file to the microSD memory card.</li>
  <li>Initialize the development hardware in PROD MODE.</li>
  <li>Start DevMenuApp from the HOME Menu.</li>
  <li>Install the NSP file from DevMenuApp.</li>
  <li>Start the application from the console.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Anchor_186060673_h1_5">Using the Feature to Save Logs to a microSD Memory Card</h1>
<p>When you use the SDEV or EDEV initialized with firmware approximating the production hardware with the feature to save logs to a microSD memory card, the logs are saved to a microSD memory card.</p>
<p>A <code>.nxbinlog</code> file is created with the log contents recorded to it under the <code>\NxBinLogs</code> directory on the microSD memory card. You can check the logs in this file by using the LogViewer tool.</p>
<p>For more information about using LogViewer, see its description page in the Document for NX package.</p>
