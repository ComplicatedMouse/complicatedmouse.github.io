<!-- Files Tab -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_1212546958">Files Tab</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The <strong>Files</strong> tab displays all of the files that were opened, read, or written during the course of the profile.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1212546958_h1_1">Sorting Files</h1>
<p>Files can be sorted by clicking on each of the column headers. By default, files are sorted by the length of time they were open.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_1">Time Open</h2>
<p>The total time the file was known to be open. If a file is opened before profiling begins or after profiling ends, the time is capped to the profile begin or end time, respectively. If the same path is opened twice, both instances count toward the total time open.</p>
<p>When a time range is selected, any file that was open during that time range will have the entire time it was open or closed shown in the <strong>Files</strong> tab, not just the time it was open within the selected time range.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_2">Opens</h2>
<p>The number of times the file was opened during the profile. Files will show open counts even if the file was opened before profiling began. This was done so that there would not be a situation where reads or writes were occurring on a file that was showing it was never opened, as such behavior is not possible.</p>
<p>When a time range is selected, any file that was open during that time range will have an open count shown in the <strong>Files</strong> tab, even if the actual Open call is not part of the selected time range.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_3">Accesses</h2>
<p>The number of times a file was either read from or written to during the profile.</p>
<p>When a time range is selected, any file that is actively being accessed during any of the selected time range will increase the access count, even if the call was started or ended outside of the selected time range.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_4">Transfer Rate</h2>
<p>The average transfer rate of all accesses that occurred for this file.</p>
<p>When a time range is selected, this value is recalculated based on the accesses that occurred during the selected time range.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_5">Buffer Size</h2>
<p>The average buffer size in bytes used when reading from or writing to this file. As this value is an average, having one very small read followed by numerous large reads of all the same size will result in the average being lower than may be initially expected.</p>
<p>When a time range is selected, this value is recalculated based on the accesses that occurred during the selected time range.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_6">Path</h2>
<p>The path used to open the file. Paths are generally standardized so that forward and backward slashes for directory separators are treated as the same file path. However, multiple directory separators in a row are counted as different paths (i.e., &quot;example:/path.bin&quot; is the same as &quot;example:\path.bin&quot;, but different from &quot;example://path.bin&quot;). When sorting by this column, all paths are sorted alphabetically.</p>
<p>There are no changes to this column based on time range selections.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1212546958_h1_2">Files Tab Toolbar</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_7">Deselect All Button</h2>
<p>To quickly deselect all selected files, click on the <strong>Deselect All</strong> button.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_8">Select Top Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Select Top</strong> button selects the first 50 files in the list, dependent on the current sort and filter.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_9">Copy Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Copy</strong> button will copy to the clipboard whatever is currently shown using the current sorting and filtering. You can then paste the content into an email, document, or Excel spreadsheet. Because the copied content uses tab delimiters, it will retain the column organization when pasted into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_10">Mounts Drop Down</h2>
<p>Click on the <strong>Mounts</strong> drop-down in the toolbar to select between &quot;All Mounts&quot; and individual mount points created. Mounts will appear in this drop-down even if no files were opened or accessed on the mount at the time of the profile. Only files that were on the selected mount point will appear in the list display.</p>
<p>In the drop down, two pieces of information are shown, the mount name and the mount type. The mount name matches the name showing up in the path. For example, in &quot;foo:/bar.bin&quot;, the text &quot;foo&quot; will appear in the drop-down. The mount type corresponds to the <span class="ApiLink_nn__fs__Mount">nn::fs::Mount</span>* API function that was called. In the case of the mount name &quot;foo&quot;, if it was mounted via <span class="ApiLink_nn__fs__MountRom">nn::fs::MountRom</span>, you will see &quot;foo <em>Rom</em>&quot; in the drop-down.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>You can duplicate this effect with regular expression filtering. For example, &quot;^foo:&quot; in a regular expression filter will find all of the files that have a path that starts with the foo mount name.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_1212546958_h2_11">Selected Only Toggle Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Selected Only</strong> button forces the list display to only show files which are currently selected. If this mode is enabled and a file is deselected, it will be removed from the displayed list. If all files are deselected, the toggle automatically disables.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1212546958_h1_3">Selecting Files</h1>
<p>Click on a file to select it. Click on the file again to unselect it. While a large number of files can be selected at once, it is recommended to keep the selected count low to improve the visibility and performance of the <a href="../Pages/Page_764970037.html"><strong>Timeline</strong></a> tab. When a file is selected, the file will draw on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab, showing when the file was opened in a light blue and when the file was accessed in a dark blue. If you can't see the file, try zooming all the way out or looking underneath the path shown in on the <strong>Timeline</strong>.</p>
<p>To quickly select the top 50 files, based on the current sort and filter, click the<strong> Select Top</strong> button in the toolbar. To quickly deselect all files, click on the <strong>Deselect All</strong> button in the toolbar.</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>To view the selected files on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab, the <a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Thread-Centric Data Views</a> experimental feature must be enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1212546958_h1_4">Right Click Context Menu</h1>
<p>A right-click in the tab will bring up a context menu with a single option.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Copy Path</strong>
</p>
<p>Selecting this item will copy the path of the file clicked on to the clipboard.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_1212546958_h1_5">Filtering Files</h1>
<p>Files can be filtered using the <strong>Filter</strong> text box at the bottom of the <strong>Files</strong> tab. This behaves similar to the <strong>Filter</strong> text box on the <strong><a href="../Pages/Page_758198897.html">Functions</a></strong> tab.</p>
