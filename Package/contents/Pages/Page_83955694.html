<h1 id="Anchor_83955694_h1_1">Introducing SoundMaker</h1>
<p>SoundMaker is a Windows application for creating sound data to use in the NintendoWare audio development environment.</p>
<p>If an application includes the <code>atk::viewer</code> library, you can use in-game editing by connecting the application to SoundMaker.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_83955694_h2_1">SoundMaker Overview</h2>
<p>In the NintendoWare audio development environment, sound data is normally handled as a single binary file called a sound archive.  <br />Sound data used as resources for the sound archive is created by using a wave editor tool or the sequencer of your choice. <br />SoundMaker creates a sound archive from sound data which is then used by the runtime library of the NintendoWare audio development environment. <br /> SoundMaker can check sounds on actual system hardware that is connected to a PC by using a dedicated sound program called AtkPlayer. In addition, you can use emulation on the computer to check some sounds during the creation process.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955694_h2_2">Main Features of SoundMaker</h2>
<p>This section describes the main features and characteristics of SoundMaker.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_1">Creating Sound Projects and Exporting Sound Archives</h3>
<p>Projects in SoundMaker are called sound projects. Each sound project can reference more than one collection of sounds, called a sound set. A single sound project corresponds to a single sound archive. <br /> Sound projects are saved in files having the extension <code>.fspj</code> (indicated hereafter as sound project files), while sound sets are saved in files having the extension <code>.fsst</code> (indicated hereafter as sound set files).</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_2">Creating Stream Sounds</h3>
<p>This type of sound is created using <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound sets</a>. Waveform files are the resources for stream sounds. Use an existing waveform editing application or <code>DAW</code> software to prepare the waveform files as <code>AIFF</code> or <code>WAV</code> files. <br />Waveform data is stereo or monaural, 16-bit or 8-bit. Any sample rate can be selected. Stream sounds are played back (by using the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> library) while loading the minimum amount of data necessary from the files.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_3">Creating Wave Sounds</h3>
<p>This type of sound is created using <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound sets</a>. First create a wave sound set group, and then create wave sounds for the individual wave sound sets. The wave data used as a wave sound resource is the same data that is used for stream sounds. <br /> To play wave sounds using the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> library, you must first load the waveform data as wave sound sets into memory.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_4">Creating Sequence Sounds</h3>
<p>This type of sound is created using <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound sets</a>. The sequence data used as the resources can be either standard MIDI files or text sequence files (FSEQ files), which are written in plain text.  <br />Prepare standard MIDI files by using your sequencer, and prepare text sequence files by using your text editor. For information about coding control changes for MIDI files and sequence commands for text sequence files, see the <em>Sequence Data Manual</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_5">Creating a Bank and Specifying Sequence Sounds</h3>
<p>Use <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound sets</a> to create banks. Specify a bank for each sequence sound. The bank functions as a tone when playing a sequence sound. <br />Bank data to be used as a resource supports special bank files (with the <code>.fbnk</code> filename extension).</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_6">Editing Bank Files</h3>
<p>Bank files are edited on the <strong>Bank</strong> tab. The <strong>Bank</strong> tab is a pane within the main window and is dedicated to editing bank files that are the materials of the banks. For each bank file, you can create more than one voice, each called an <em>instrument</em>. Instruments are placed on the <em>instrument list</em>. The program number that corresponds to the MIDI program change is defined. <br />Instruments reference waveform files as resources. The waveform data in resources for bank files is the same data that is used with stream sounds or wave sounds. <br /> To play banks using the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> library, you must first load the waveform data as instruments into memory, similar to the requirement for playing wave sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_7">Creating 3D Sounds</h3>
<p>3D sounds are created by using a <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound set</a>. Operations when playing a sound using 3D sound are set for each sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_8">Creating a Player and Specifying a Player for Each Sound</h3>
<p>Create a player by using the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound set</a>, and then specify a player for each sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_9">Creating Groups and Registering Sound Data With Groups</h3>
<p>Create a group by using a <a href="../Pages/Page_83956225.html#Anchor_83956225_SND_SET">sound set</a>, and then register each sound with the created group as an item.  <br />The <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> library loads the playback data and waveform data required for playing sounds into memory at the group level.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_10">Importing Existing File Formats</h3>
<p>Imports projects, sound sets, bank files, and effect sound definition files (STXT files) from different platforms to the sound project.</p>
<p>An STXT file is an effect sound definition file that is used by the <code>sysdolphin</code> audio library. This library is used as the development environment for the Nintendo GameCube game console. This feature is used when porting game projects created using <code>Sysdolphin</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_11">Creating Sound Archives</h3>
<p>A sound archive is created from a Sound Project. All referenced files use a special converter.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_12">Sound Verification Through PC Emulation</h3>
<p>SoundMaker supports the playback of instruments by using PC emulation. This allows you to check sounds to a certain degree even without a development kit. <br />PC emulation can also be used to play MIDI signals connected to the computer.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955694_h3_13">Starting AtkPlayer and Checking Sounds on Actual Hardware</h3>
<p>Sound archives created with SoundMaker can be checked by starting AtkPlayer from inside the tool.</p>
