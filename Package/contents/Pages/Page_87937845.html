<h1 id="Anchor_87937845_h1_1">Introduction</h1>
<p>NVN is a low-level 3D graphics API that is supported by NintendoSDK NX Add-On. This API is directly connected to the hardware specification and has no abstraction layers to absorb hardware differences. As a result, the CPU overhead for this API is reduced.</p>
<p>NVN provides the ability to manipulate objects with finer granularity than the <code>gfx</code> library, a benefit to NintendoSDK users when they incorporate the APIs into their own proprietary game engines. However, because NVN is specialized for the hardware, for reasons of compatibility, we recommend using the <code>gfx</code> library (which wraps NVN) as the graphics API for NintendoSDK. Also, use the features described in <a href="../Pages/Page_95694638.html">Interoperability With Low-Level Graphics APIs</a> to use NVN only where needed.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_87937845_h1_2">PC Operating Environment</h1>
<p>This environment is the PC operating environment required for NVN. The SDEV operating environment complies with the NintendoSDK operating environment.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_87937845_h2_1">Installing the Graphics Driver </h2>
<p>To use NVN on a PC, you must install a dedicated driver.</p>
<p>You can get the installer file by installing the NVIDIA Graphics Driver package from the Nintendo Dev Interface. You can start the appropriate installer for your operating system from the dialog box displayed during package installation. If you did not start the installer from the dialog box, you can install the driver by running the <code>Install.bat</code> file located in <code>NintendoSDK/Installers/NvnDriver</code>. Batch files are prepared for each operating system, so run the batch file for the operating system you use.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_87937845_h3_1">Standard and DCH Versions</h3>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>The DCH version of NVIDIA Graphics Driver is provided in NX Add-On 9.1.0 and later.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>There are two versions of the driver for Windows 10: the standard version and the DCH version.</p>
<p>There are no differences in the NVN driver functionality provided by these two versions. Select the version that suits your environment.</p>
<p>In an environment where NVIDIA Graphics Driver is already installed, you cannot install a different type (standard or DCH) of the driver.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_87937845_h2_2">Supported GPU and Supported Features</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The library supports Maxwell first generation and later GPU architectures with some feature limitations. Note that several NX hardware features will not be available if you are using a GPU architecture <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"><strong>earlier than Maxwell second generation</strong></span>. In addition, some GPU model numbers are not supported. For more information, see the <a href="../external.html?file=../../Api/HtmlNX/nvn_index.html">NVN programming guide</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, note that when using the dedicated NVN graphics debugger for NVN applications that run on PC, several of the graphics debugger features will not be available if you are using a GPU architecture <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"><strong>other than Maxwell second generation</strong></span>. For more information, see the documentation included in the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a> package.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following table lists the NVN and NVN debugger support status for each application operating environment.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_87937845_h2_3">nvn.dll</h2>
<p>Starting with NX Add-On 12.1.0, <code>nvn.dll</code> is required in addition to the NVIDIA Graphics Driver to use NVN in the PC environment. This is located in <code>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT%/Tools/Graphics/NvnLoader</code>.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../external.html?file=../../Api/HtmlNX/nvn_index.html">NVN Programming Guide</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_87937845_h1_3">
  <br />Limitations</h1>
<p>NVN uses GLSL/SPIR-V as shader languages. When they are used from NVN, testing using the Khronos Conformance Test is not performed. For this reason, there may be differences with the Khronos GLSL/SPIR-V specifications.</p>
