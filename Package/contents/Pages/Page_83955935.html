<h2 id="Anchor_83955935_h2_1">Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This section lists the file formats used in the NintendoWare audio development environment.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>There are two main types of sound files: <strong>those used by SoundMaker, and those used by the Atk library</strong>.</li>
    <li>Temporary sound files are also created during conversion. These files ultimately end up in the binary sound archive (BCFAR) file, but in most cases you do not need to work with them directly.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955935_h2_2">File Formats Used in SoundMaker</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_1">fspj</h3>
<p>SoundMaker project files  (<strong>S</strong>oundMaker <strong>P</strong>ro<strong>j</strong>ect) .</p>
<p>The FSPJ file is an XML file that contains information about all sound set files (FSST files) in the project, in addition to any information entered in the <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Project Settings</strong> of SoundMaker.</p>
<p>This file is created when you start a new project in SoundMaker. <br /> You can specify the directory in which to create the file at that time.</p>
<p>You can open this FSPJ file by starting SoundMaker and selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Project</strong>, or by dragging it to the Project Tree.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_2">fsst</h3>
<p>SoundMaker sound set files (<strong>S</strong>ound<strong>S</strong>e<strong>t</strong>).</p>
<p>This file is an XML file containing information about the sounds, wave and sequence sound sets, sound banks, waveform archives, groups, and sound player settings in a sound set.</p>
<p>A file is created each time you create a new sound set in the SoundMaker project tree. <br /> You can specify the directory in which to create the file at that time.</p>
<p>You can see what a sound set contains by looking at the node for that sound set under its project node in the SoundMaker <strong>Project Tree</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_3">fbnk</h3>
<p>SoundMaker bank files (<strong>B</strong>a<strong>nk</strong>).</p>
<p>This file is an XML file with information about the instruments in that sound bank.</p>
<p>A file is created each time you create a new sound bank in the SoundMaker bank list. <br /> You can specify the directory in which to create the file at that time.</p>
<p>You can see what a sound bank contains by looking at the bank list that is displayed when you select the node for that bank under its sound set node in the SoundMaker Project Tree, or by looking at the <strong>Bank</strong> tab that is displayed when you select any of the child nodes of the bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_4">fseq</h3>
<p>SoundMaker text sequence files (<strong>Seq</strong>uence).</p>
<p>FSEQ files contain text sequences in a proprietary NintendoWare format.</p>
<p>You can create these text sequence files using any text editor. <br />You can also create text sequence files by converting the SMF files in the SoundMaker sequence sound list. <br />You can specify the directory in which to create the file at that time.</p>
<p>The character codes that can be used in text sequence files are ANSI and Shift_JIS.</p>
<p>For more information about text sequence files, see <a href="../Pages/Page_83955735.html">Text Sequences</a> in the <em>Sequence Data Manual</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_5">finl</h3>
<p>SoundMaker instrument list files (<strong>In</strong>st <strong>L</strong>ist).</p>
<p>This file defines the list of IDs for the instrument labels in a sound bank.</p>
<p>The file is created in the same directory as the corresponding bank file (FBNK file) when that bank file is converted.  An instrument list file is created for each sound bank file.</p>
<p>You can use the instrument labels stored in the FINL file by including it at the beginning of a text sequence (FSEQ) file. <br />For an example, see <a href="../Pages/Page_83955543.html#Anchor_83955543_INCLUDE_Example">Sequence Data Manual - Preprocessor Directives - Using #include</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955935_h2_3">Temporary Intermediate Files Created During Conversion</h2>
<p>These files are ultimately stored in the final sound archive (BFSAR) file. <br />In most cases, you never need to deal with these files directly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_6">bfwav</h3>
<p>NintendoWare audio binary waveform files.</p>
<p>These files contain data from waveform files (such as WAV or AIFF) that have been converted to binary.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project (FSPJ) file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are created in the <code>cache</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_7">bfbnk</h3>
<p>NintendoWare audio binary bank files.</p>
<p>These files are simply sound bank (FBNK) files that have been converted to binary.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project (FSPJ) file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported into the <code>cache</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One BFBNK file is created for each sound bank in a sound set (FSST) file.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_8">bfseq</h3>
<p>NintendoWare audio binary sequence files.</p>
<p>These files are simply sequence (FSEQ) files that have been converted to binary.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project (FSPJ) file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported into the <code>cache</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One BFSEQ file is created for each sequence (FSEQ or MID) file.</p>
<p>(If you are using SMF-type sequence sound files, they are first converted to text sequence (FSEQ) files and then into binary sequence files. The intermediate files are exported to <code>cache/<em>name_of_text_sequence_file</em>.fseq.</code>  )</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_9">bfwsd</h3>
<p>NintendoWare audio binary wave sound files.</p>
<p>These files are binary files with information about the wave sounds in the sound set (FSST) files specified by the project (FSPJ) file.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported into the <code>cache</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One binary sound file is created for each wave sound set in each sound set file.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_10">bfwar</h3>
<p>NintendoWare audio binary waveform archive files.</p>
<p>These files are binary files with information about the waveform archives in the sound set (FSST) files specified by the project (FSPJ) file.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported into the <code>cache</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One binary waveform archive file is created for each waveform archive in each sound set file.</p>
<p>If you specified <strong>Automatic (shared/individual)</strong> in the waveform archive settings for bank/wave sound sets, one binary waveform archive file is created for each bank/wave sound set.</p>
<p>If, however, you specified <strong>Automatic (shared)</strong> and those bank/wave sound sets belong to a group, only one binary waveform archive file might be created for each group. <br />For more information about the relationship between groups and waveform archive settings for bank/wave sound sets, see Groups.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955935_h2_4">Files Used in the Atk Library</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_11">fsid</h3>
<p>Sound ID files used by the Atk library.</p>
<p>These files are C/C++ files that contain the names of all items in a sound archive.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project (FSPJ) file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported to the <code>output</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One sound ID file is created for each project file.</p>
<p>By including the file in your application, you can specify the IDs defined in the file to load sound data and play sounds.</p>
<p>(By using label string data, <br />you can use the Atk library without including sound ID files. For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_89117336.html">Programming Guide</a>.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_12">bfsar</h3>
<p>Binary sound archive file used by the Atk library.</p>
<p>This file is a binary file with information about the various items in the sound set (FSST) files specified by the project (FSPJ) file.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, it is exported to the <code>output</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One binary sound archive file is created for each project file.</p>
<p>You can get information about the sounds, banks and other items in the sound sets by using the appropriate <code>SoundArchive</code> subclass. <br />You can load the sound data from sound archives using the <code>SoundDataManager</code> class.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_13">bfstm</h3>
<p>Binary stream file used by the Atk library.</p>
<p>These files are binary files with information about the stream sounds in the sound set (FSST) files specified by the project (FSPJ) file.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported into the <code>stream</code> folder under the <code>output</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One binary stream file is created for each stream sound registered in each sound set file.</p>
<p>The sound data and parameters in these files are used when playing stream sounds with the sound library.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955935_h3_14">bfgrp</h3>
<p>Binary group file used by the Atk library.</p>
<p>These files are binary files with information about user-managed groups in the sound set (FSST) files specified by the project (FSPJ) file.</p>
<p>They are created when you convert a project file using SoundMaker or SoundProjectConverter. <br /> Normally, they are exported into the <code>userManagementFiles</code> folder under the <code>output</code> folder at the same level in the directory as the base project file. One binary group file is created for each user-managed group registered in each sound set file.</p>
<p>Loading the files in your application enables you to access all of the sounds in those groups.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955935_h2_5">Converting Sounds in SoundMaker</h2>
<p>The following diagram provides an overview of the file formats used in the NintendoWare audio development environment.</p>
<p>In most cases, you only need to work with the files on the leftmost and rightmost sides.</p>
<p>The conversion by SoundMaker ultimately generates sound files that are used by the sound library, but there are also temporary files created during the process.</p>
<p>Various information is exported to <code>output/***Map.html</code> files, which you can check to see what kinds of binary data are included in the final BFSAR file.</p>
