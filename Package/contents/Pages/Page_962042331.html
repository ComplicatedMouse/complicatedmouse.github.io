<div class="text_separate">
<p>This tab contains options that control the profiler's experimental features.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_962042331_h1_1">Enable Thread-Centric Data Views</h1>
<p>Controls the <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> feature. When this feature is enabled, experimental versions of the&nbsp;<strong>Functions</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Threads</strong> tabs will be displayed in the left window, and the experimental&nbsp;<strong>Call Tree </strong>and<strong> Timeline&nbsp;</strong>tabs will be displayed in the right window when a profile has been loaded. The data can be grouped into one of three function group modes, allowing&nbsp;the data to be summarized and analyzed in multiple ways.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_962042331_h2_1">Function Grouping Modes</h2>
<p>The function grouping mode can be changed in the mode dropdown of the new <strong>Functions</strong> and <strong>Call Tree</strong> experimental tabs, or by clicking on the <strong>Type</strong> column header in the <strong>Functions</strong>&nbsp;tab. Changing the mode will control how data in the <strong>Functions</strong> and <strong>Call Tree</strong> tabs are organized. The modes are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_962042331_h3_1">Function then Threads</h3>
<p>In this mode, the items at the root of the list are functions. The function percentage or time represents the overall totals for each function, regardless of what thread or core it was running on. The items in the next level of the hierarchy are threads. The thread percentage or time&nbsp;represents the function's data by thread, regardless of which core the thread ran on. The items in the last level of the hierarchy are cores, which have the data for the specific function on the specific thread for the specific core.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_962042331_h3_2">Thread then Functions</h3>
<p>In this mode, the items at the root of the list are threads. The thread percentage or time&nbsp;represents the overall totals for each thread, regardless of what functions it was running or what core it was running on. The items in the next level of the hierarchy are functions. The function's data represents the thread's data by function, regardless of which core the thread and function were running on. The items in the last level of the hierarchy are cores. The core data represents the data for the specific thread running the specific function on the specific core.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_962042331_h3_3">Core then Threads</h3>
<p>In this mode, the items at the root of the list are cores. The core percentage or time&nbsp;represents the overall totals for each core, regardless of what threads or functions were running on each core. The items in the next level of the hierarchy are threads. The thread's data represents the aggregate of all functions that were observed to be running on the specific core and thread. The items in the last level of the hierarchy are functions.&nbsp;The function data represents the data for the specific function running on the specific thread and core.</p>
