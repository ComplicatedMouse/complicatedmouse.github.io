<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_758198916">Instrumented Tab</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Instrumented</strong> tab displays all instrumented functions and all instrumented code blocks that were&nbsp;recorded during a profile. The <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Instrumented</strong> tab will only appear if either of these types of data were&nbsp;recorded.</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>These notes point out differences in the&nbsp;<strong>Instrumented</strong> tab when the <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> experimental feature is enabled. See&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Experimental Features Tab</a> for additional information.</p>
  </div>

<h1 id="Anchor_758198916_h1_1">Instrumented Tab Toolbar</h1>
<p>The following controls are in the&nbsp;<strong>Instrumented</strong>&nbsp;tab toolbar.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Deselect All:&nbsp;</strong>Deselects all selected items.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Expand All:&nbsp;</strong>Expands all items in the view.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collapse All:</strong>&nbsp;Collapses all items in the view.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Show Only Sort Value:</strong>&nbsp;Filters out all items in the view except those that are being sorted on.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Select Similar:</strong>&nbsp;When enabled, the selecting or deselecting of an item causes similarly named items to be&nbsp;selected or deselected.&nbsp;Only expanded blocks are evaluated for&nbsp;<strong>Select Similar</strong>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Copy:</strong>&nbsp;Copies to the clipboard whatever is currently shown using the current sorting and&nbsp;filtering. You can then paste the content into an email, document, or Excel spreadsheet. Because the&nbsp;copied content uses tab delimiters, it will retain the column organization when pasted into an Excel&nbsp;spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Filter:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cores:&nbsp;</strong>Filters the items in the view so that only items found on the selected core will be shown. Only cores with data available in this tab are shown in this drop-down.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Threads:&nbsp;</strong>Filters the items in the view so that only items found on the selected thread will be shown. Only threads with data available in this tab are shown in this drop-down.<strong><br /></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Sort:&nbsp;</strong>Items in the instrumented tab can be sorted by the data they contain. The sorting methods that are available depend on the type of data recorded in the instrumented tab.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>The <strong>Show Only Sort Value</strong>, <strong>Core Filter</strong>, and <strong>Sort</strong> toolbar controls are not present due to the changes in the tab. Instead, the following toolbar controls have been added.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Expand Selected Only</strong>: Collapse and Expand all items in the view so that only parents that have children selected are expanded.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Details</strong>: When toggled on, show additional columns in the display.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Selected Only</strong>: When toggled on, only show selected items and their parents in the display. This button can only be toggled on if something is selected. If everything is deselected, the button will automatically toggle off.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198916_h1_2">Instrumented Items</h1>
<p>Instrumented items can be expanded to view all of the data that was recorded during the profile. The&nbsp;following measurements should appear for each instrumented item.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Function Calls</strong> or <strong>Blocks</strong>: The number of times the function or code block was entered and exited&nbsp;during the profile.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Max Recursive Depth</strong>: Displays the max recursive depth that was detected during the profile. This&nbsp;measurement only appears if the value is greater than zero.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Time per Call</strong> or <strong>Time per Block</strong>: This is the average time per call or block that was measured (time =&nbsp;total time / number of calls).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>The view when Thread-Centric Data Views has been significantly changed. Rather than having data displayed as value/name pairs, the data is displayed in a table much like those seen on the <strong>Functions</strong> and <strong>Threads</strong> tabs.</p>
    <h2 id="Anchor_758198916_h2_1">Columns</h2>
    <p>Some of the columns are only displayed when the <strong>Details</strong> button is toggled on. Clicking on the column header will sort by that column, except for the <strong>Type</strong> column.</p>
    <h3 id="Anchor_758198916_h3_1">Type</h3>
    <p>Shows what kind of data is represented on this line of the view.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Block</strong>: Shows the combination of the data for named Code Block or instrumented function, regardless of the core or thread that it was used on. It can be expanded to show a breakdown at a per-thread level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thread</strong>: Shows the named Code Block or instrumented function data based on the thread it was running on, regardless of the core that was executing that thread.</p>
    <p>This value does not updating when selecting a time range.</p>
    <h3 id="Anchor_758198916_h3_2">Blocks</h3>
    <p>The number of times the Code Block or instrumented function was entered and exited. When profile data is loaded, if there is a mismatch in the number of enters and exits, the profiler will automatically balance the code blocks by inserting enters at the beginning of the profile and exits at the end of the profile.</p>
    <p>When selecting a time range on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab, the values in this column will update. Only blocks that are both entered and exited within the time range are shown in the column.</p>
    <h3 id="Anchor_758198916_h3_3">Avg Time</h3>
    <p>The average time spent executing the Code Block or instrumented function. When profile data is loaded, if there is a mismatch in the number of enters and exits, the profiler will automatically balance the code blocks by inserting enters at the beginning of the profile and exits at the end of the profile. This may cause a slight reduction in the average time.</p>
    <p>When selecting a time range on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab, the values in this column will update. Only blocks that are both entered and exited within the time range are used to calculate the average time.</p>
    <h3 id="Anchor_758198916_h3_4">Recursions</h3>
    <p>Only visible when the <strong>Details</strong> button is toggled on.</p>
    <p>The maximum number of recursions seen by this Code Block or instrumented function. A recursion is defined as a block occurring on the same thread appearing within the time range a block&nbsp;with the same name is already covering.</p>
    <p>When selecting a time range on the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab, the values in this column will update. Only blocks that are both entered and exited within the time range are considered, though the recursive parents do not need to be fully selected.</p>
    <h3 id="Anchor_758198916_h3_5">Cores</h3>
    <p>Only visible when the <strong>Details</strong> button is toggled on.</p>
    <p>A list of the cores which executed the Code Block or instrumented function.</p>
    <p>This value does not update when selecting a time range.</p>
    <h3 id="Anchor_758198916_h3_6">Name</h3>
    <p>The name associated with the <strong>Type</strong> column.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Block</strong>: The name of the Code Block or instrumented function.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thread</strong>: The name of the thread on which the Code Block or instrumented was seen.</p>
    <p>This value does not update when selecting a time range.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198916_h1_3">Selecting Instrumented Items to Graph</h1>
<p>Selecting data fields within each instrumented item will cause them to be graphed within the <strong>Timeline</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>
<p>To select similar data fields within all expanded items, enable the <strong>Select Similar</strong> button in the&nbsp;<strong>Instrumented</strong> tab toolbar and click on a single data field.</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>When blocks are drawn in the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab, they will appear in two sections.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Code Blocks by Thread</strong>: A hierarchy view of Code Block and instrumented functions showing the relationship between the blocks on the threads over time.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Code Blocks</strong>: A view of when the selected Code Block or instrumented function was executing. If there were any recursions, the height of this graph will increase to show those recursions.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Select Similar</strong> button has been removed.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198916_h2_2">Alternative Selection Methods</h2>
<p>Multiple items can be selected or deselected with <strong>Shift+Click</strong> (select/deselect an item without holding the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong> key, then hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key and click on a second item). The range between the two clicks will be&nbsp;either selected or deselected.</p>
<p>To quickly select only a single item and deselect everything else, <strong>Alt+Click</strong> can be used. This deselects all&nbsp;and then selects the clicked upon item.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198916_h1_4">Filtering the Instrumented tab</h1>
<p>The <strong>Instrumented</strong> tab can be filtered using the&nbsp;<strong>Filter</strong>&nbsp;text box at the bottom of the tab.&nbsp;This behaves similar to the&nbsp;<strong>Filter</strong>&nbsp;text box on the&nbsp;<strong>Functions</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>
