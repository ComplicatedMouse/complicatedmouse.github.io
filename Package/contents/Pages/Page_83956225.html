<p>This section describes how to create the sound project that you need when you first use <code>SoundMaker</code>. A sound project consists of one sound project file (<code>.fspj</code>) and one or more sound set files (<code>.fsst</code>) that have been registered for reference by that sound project file.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_1">What Is a Sound Project?</h3>
<p>A sound project is a project file in SoundMaker. A sound project must be created first when you begin to work with SoundMaker.</p>
<p>A sound project consists of one sound project file (FSPJ file) and one or more sound set files (FSST files). <br />The actual task of creating sounds is primarily performed on sound sets (by using sound set files). Sounds can be classified into separate categories at the level of sound set files, and these can be managed by more than one staff member.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_2">Creating Sound Projects</h3>
<p>Select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Create New Project</strong>. <br />A new project creation wizard starts. Follow the instructions on the wizard to create a sound project.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956225_h4_1">New Project Creation Wizard</h4>

  </span>
</p>
<p>First, specify a project name and path. <br />The project name that you specify is the sound project filename, and is also used as the sound archive filename at the time of conversion.<br /> To create a sound set at the same time as the sound project, select <strong>Create a new sound set</strong>. <br />Make sure that you select <strong>Specify existing sound set</strong> when you use an existing sound set file.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83956225/124256409.gif" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>After you have specified these settings, click <strong>Complete</strong> to create the sound project.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956225_h2_2">
  <a name="Anchor_83956225_SND_SET"></a>Creating Sound Sets</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_3">What Is a Sound Set?</h3>
<p>A sound set is a small-scale collection of all the information that is required to create a sound archive.<br />The actual task of creating sounds is primarily carried out on sound sets (by using sound set files). <br />Sound sets are saved in sound set files (FSST files). More than one sound set file can be registered as a reference for a sound project.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_4">Creating Sound Sets</h3>
<p>You can skip this procedure if you selected the <strong>Create new sound set</strong> option in the <strong>Create New Project</strong> wizard when you created a sound project, because a sound set was created at that time.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956225_h4_2">Creating New Sound Set Files</h4>
<p>Select <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Sound Set</strong> &gt; <strong>New Sound Set</strong>. <br />The <strong>Create New Sound Set</strong> dialog box appears. Specify a sound set name and the path to use for the new sound set file.<br /> The sound set name that you enter is used as the filename. A sound set file is created at the specified path location. Simultaneously, the created sound set file is registered with the sound project as a reference.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83956225/124256410.gif" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956225_h4_3">Using Existing Sound Set Files</h4>
<p>When using a sound set file that has already been created, select <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Sound Set</strong> &gt; <strong>Existing Sound Set</strong>. <br />In the dialog box, select the sound set file to register with the sound project. <br />The specified sound set file is registered with the sound project as a reference.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956225_h4_4">Sound Set Names</h4>
<p>As with comments, sound set names can use any characters, including Japanese characters. <br />(However, the characters <code>\</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>:</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>&quot;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>|</code> cannot be used.<br />Other item names can use only single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9_]. <br />(Note that numeric characters cannot be used to start a name.)<br />This name is exported to the HTML sound list.</p>
<p>Sound set names can be changed in the project tree.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_83956225_h2_3">
  <a name="Anchor_83956225_SND_SET_ELEM"></a>Elements of a Sound Set</h2>
<p>This section describes the elements that make up a sound set.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_5">Stream Sounds (STRM)</h3>
<p>Sounds that are played back using software streaming from storage are called &quot;stream sounds.&quot; <br />Instruments reference external waveform files as resources.</p>
<p>Stream sounds are suitable for playback of content, such as background music, using a large waveform file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_6">Wave Sound (WSD)</h3>
<p>Sounds that are played by using waveform data that is loaded into memory are called <em>wave sounds</em>. <br />Instruments reference external waveform files as resources.</p>
<p>Wave sounds are suitable for the playback of effects that use, for example, one-shot waveform files.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_7">Sequence Sounds (SEQ)</h3>
<p>Sounds that are played by using sequence (MIDI) performance information and tones (banks) loaded into memory are called <em>sequence sounds</em>. <br />Either an external standard MIDI file that is created with a sequencer, or a text sequence file that is created with a text editor, are referenced as a resource.</p>
<p>Because sequence sounds provide a greater freedom to change the tempo and make other musical manipulations, they are well suited for background music and musical-type sound effects.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_8">Banks (BANK)</h3>
<p>Sounds that are used by a sequence are called a <em>bank</em>. <br />A bank file that is created under SoundMaker is referenced as a resource.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_9">Waveform Archives (WARC)</h3>
<p>Collections of more than one instance of waveform data are referred to as a <em>waveform archive</em>. <br />Waveform data is much larger than bank data. Accordingly, bank data and waveform archive data are handled separately. <br />This allows for more efficient memory usage, such as referencing a single waveform archive used by multiple different banks.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_10">Players (PLAYER)</h3>
<p>The entity that controls playback of stream, wave, sequence sounds, and so on is called a <em>player</em>. <br />A player must be specified for all sounds.</p>
<p>A sound limit can be specified for a player. This sound limit value can control the specified number of sounds that can be played back with a player.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956225_h3_11">Groups (GROUP)</h3>
<p>Waveform data and playback data must be loaded into memory to play sequence sounds (banks), wave sounds, and so on. <br />The items included in a sound set can be registered and gathered together in a group. <br />The application can then operate at a group level to load the waveform data and playback data into memory.</p>
<p>If you use only SoundMaker to confirm sounds, group creation and registration of items to groups is not necessary.</p>
