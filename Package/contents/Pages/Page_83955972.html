<h1 id="Anchor_83955972_h1_1">Indirect Texture</h1>
<p>This section describes how to use the <strong>Indirect Texture</strong> feature.<br /> The <strong>Indirect Texture</strong> feature warps one texture image using a different texture image.<br /> Complex effects can be created through the combined use of the texture causing the warping and the texture being warped.<br /> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/240721361.png" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955972_h2_1">Structure of Indirect Processing</h2>
<p>This section describes the indirect processing mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955972_h3_1">Handling Each Component of an Indirect Texture</h3>
<p>The examples show how the various indirect texture components are handled.<br /> The basic amount of warping in the horizontal and vertical directions is determined by the values of the R and A components, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955972_h4_1">Example １</h4>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080407.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>If you have a 2-channel format indirect texture (the texture shown in the middle) and its R component and A component are both set to 128, no distortion occurs as a result of indirect processing.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955972_h4_2">Example ２</h4>
<p>Warping occurs, but only in the region of the indirect texture (the texture shown in the middle) where its R and A components are set to values other than 128 (the circle in the center of the image of the indirect texture).<br /> (Both the distorted texture and the indirect texture have a size of 256 &times; 256, with the center circle of the indirect texture having a size of 128 pixels.)</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83955972_h3_2">Modifying the Degree of Warping Using the Indirect Matrix</h3>
<p>You can apply scale and rotational transformations to the amount of warping affected by the indirect texture in the separate horizontal and vertical directions.<br /> Because you can set animation to Scale and Rotate, you can use this to create interesting effects.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955972_h2_2">Using the Texture Warp Feature</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955972_h3_3">Main Steps of Setting Indirect Textures</h3>
<p>The following three steps make up the majority of the workflow for configuring indirect texture settings.</p>
<p>I. Load the texture.<br /> II. Configure the texture settings for the material in the property window. (Specify at least two textures, a standard texture and an indirect texture.<br /> III. Configure the texture combiner settings for the material in the property window.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955972_h2_3">Using Indirect Textures on Three Textures</h2>
<p>This section walks through an example of configuring indirect textures using three different textures.<br />LayoutEditor 2.9.0 and earlier supported uses of indirect textures other than the one in this description (such as setting two indirect texture methods for one target texture). However, these uses could cause system instability.<br />Starting in LayoutEditor 2.9.0, you cannot configure potentially unstable indirect texture configurations.</p>

<p>As shown in the following image, the first texture is distorted based on the characteristics of the second texture, and the result is combined with the third texture.</p>
