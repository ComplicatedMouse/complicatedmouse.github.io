<!-- Plug-In for Setting Animation Binary Output -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_83955863">Plug-In for Setting Animation Binary Output</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>This plug-in sets the flags to output the animation binary for transform nodes and joint nodes.</p>
<p>You can also search for the settings.</p>
<p>It can be used for the following purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To clear the flag to output the binary for skeletal animation data for nodes for which you do not want to play skeletal animations.</li>
  <li>To clear the flag to output skeletal animation translation binary to make common use of a rotation animation for characters with different physiques.</li>
  <li>To clear the flag to output the binary for visibility animation data for nodes for which you do not want to play visibility animations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_83955863_h1_1">How to Use</h1>
<p>Select <strong>Nintendo</strong> &gt; <strong>Set Animation Binarization</strong> to open the window.</p>
<p>Selected transform nodes and joint nodes are displayed under <strong>Selected Transform Node</strong>.<br />Click a node name to select that node.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955863_h2_1">Setting Method</h2>
<p>When one or more transform nodes or joint nodes are selected, the current setting for the selected node is displayed under <strong>Set</strong>. If you select multiple nodes, the setting for the first selected node is displayed.</p>
<p>Change the binary output flags by selecting or clearing the check boxes.<br />You can select multiple nodes to change them all at the same time. (Only the changed binary output flags are applied.)</p>
<p>You can configure the setting for a different node by keeping the window open and selecting a different node.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955863_h3_1">Binarizing Skeletal Animation</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Bone Animation</strong> sets the flag to output the binary for the bone's skeletal animation data. (This feature is available in Nintendo SDK 10.0.0 and later.) If <strong>Bone Animation</strong> is cleared, that node's skeletal animation data is not output to the binary file, just as if that node did not exist (and does not have any influence on animation blending).<br /></p>
<p>
  <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">
    <strong>Scale</strong>, <strong>Rotate</strong>, and <strong>Translate</strong> set the individual flags to output the binary for the skeletal animation's scaling, rotation, and translation. If cleared, the translation, rotation, and scaling values of the FMD file are used.<br /></span>
</p>
<p>By default, all of the flags are selected.</p>
<p>If <strong>Bone Animation</strong> is selected and <strong>Scale</strong>, <strong>Rotate</strong>, and <strong>Translate</strong> are all set to <strong>OFF</strong>, the animation becomes a fixed animation that uses the SRT values of the FMD file. This affects animation blending.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955863_h3_2">Binarize Visibility Animation<br /></h3>
<p>
  <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Visibility</strong> sets the flag to export the binary for the visibility animation data for the bone. (This feature is available in NintendoSDK 10.0.0 and later.) If <strong>Visibility</strong> is cleared, that node's skeletal animation data is not exported to the binary file, just as if that node did not exist. This option is enabled by default.</p>
<p>When <code>export_bone_visibility_all=&quot;false&quot;</code> has been specified in the config file, this binary is exported if the new flag is set and the animation has been set as visible.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955863_h3_3">Custom Attributes</h3>
<p>When changing the binary output flag, custom attributes are added to the selected nodes if they do not already exist.<br />Custom attributes are displayed with the following names in the channel box.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>NW Binarize Bone Anim</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NW4F Binarize Translate</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NW4F Binarize Rotate</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NW4F Binarize Scale</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NW Binarize Visibility Anim</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you set keys for custom attributes, you can change the binary output flag based on the animation starting frame (this feature is primarily intended for multi-export plug-ins).<br />However, if a key with a different value is set on a between the start and end frame, only the value in the start frame is applied in the intermediate file.</p>
<p>It was not possible to set keys for custom attributes added in NintendoSDK 9.x.x and earlier. When you select a node while the binary output selection plug-in is running in NintendoSDK 10.0.0 and later, if keys could not be set for the <strong>NW4F Binarize Translate</strong>, <strong>NW4F Binarize Rotate</strong>, and <strong>NW4F Binarize Scale</strong> custom attributes, they are automatically changed to allow keys to be set.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955863_h2_2">Searching</h2>
<p>To select particular transform nodes and joint nodes, in <strong>Search</strong>, select the check boxes for the nodes, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.<br />To search for nodes that satisfy all of the binary output flag settings, select the <strong>and</strong> radio button located to the left of the <strong>Search</strong> button.<br />To search for nodes that satisfy at least one of the items, select <strong>or</strong>.</p>
