<h2 id="Anchor_83956172_h2_1">Role of the Percussion List</h2>
<p>The <strong>Percussion List</strong> is a special editor for editing instruments.<br />You can edit instruments that are selected on the <strong>Instrument List</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Percussion List</strong> is an editor for multi-region instruments, similar to the <strong>Sample Map</strong>. However, unlike the <strong>Sample Map</strong>, the <strong>Percussion List</strong> displays a vertical keyboard.<br />The <strong>Percussion List</strong> differs from the <strong>Sample Map</strong> in that it is used to create instruments that require many small key maps in a very limited range, such as percussion instruments.<br />Velocity regions cannot be handled in the <strong>Percussion List</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956172_h2_2">Percussion List Operations</h2>
<p>This section describes the operations possible with the <strong>Percussion List</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_1">Creating Key Regions</h3>
<p>To create key regions, right-click the list and select <strong>Split Key Region</strong> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>The <strong>Percussion List</strong> corresponds to a keyboard, with notes listed in order starting from low notes to high notes.<br />The created key region extends downward in the list from the row where the division operation was performed, to the higher note where the next key region starts.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_2">Creating Velocity Regions</h3>
<p>Velocity regions cannot be created in the <strong>Percussion List</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_3">Opening a Folder or Reference File</h3>
<p>To open a folder or reference file, right-click the file to open the shortcut menu, and select either <strong>Open Folder</strong> or <strong>Open Referenced File</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956172_h2_3">Editing the Percussion List</h2>
<p>This section describes the meaning of each of the elements that defines a <strong>Percussion List</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_4">Compression Format</h3>
<p>Specifies the compression format to use when you convert reference waveform files.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ADPCM</strong>
    <br />Converts the waveform file to the proprietary ADPCM format.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>PCM16</strong>
    <br />Converts the file to 16-bit PCM data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_5">File path</h3>
<p>Specifies the waveform file that the region references.</p>
<p>The characters that can be used in a filename or path name are restricted. The following characters can be used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character of the filename.</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _] for subsequent characters in the filename.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_6">Playback time</h3>
<p>Displays the playback time for sounds (the length of the waveform data expressed as time).<br />The units are displayed in <em>mm:ss. ms</em> and the value in milliseconds are rounded to the second digit.</p>
<p>For looped waveform data, this shows the time to the end of the loop, not the length of the waveform itself.<br />In addition, an <strong>L</strong> is displayed at the front of the cell.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_7">Ticks</h3>
<p>Displays the length of the required note commands.<br />Ticks are units for specifying the length of notes and rests within text sequences.</p>
<p>The number of ticks per minute (tpm) and ticks per second (tps) depend on both the tempo and the quarter note resolution. Assuming that the default tempo value of 120 quarter notes per minute (qpm) is set, and that the quarter note resolution of the text sequence is set to the default value of 48 (which differs from the value of the <strong>SMF Quarter Note Resolution</strong> setting under <strong>Project Settings</strong>), the tpm and tps rates can be calculated as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 minute = 120 * 48 = 5,760 ticks</li>
  <li>1 second = 120 * 48 / 60 = 96 ticks</li>
</ul>
<p>The tempo and quarter note resolution values correspond to these rates.</p>
<p>Knowing the number of ticks is useful when writing text sequences.</p>
<p>Note that changing the pitch of an instrument causes the actual playback duration to increase or decrease, and the number of actual ticks taken for playback to change accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_8">Sample Rate</h3>
<p>Displays the sample rate of the waveform file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_9">Bit Rate</h3>
<p>Displays the bit rate of the waveform file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_10">Number of Quantization Bits</h3>
<p>Displays the quantifying bit number of the waveform file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_11">Number of Channels</h3>
<p>If there are one or two waveform channels, either <strong>Mono</strong> or <strong>Stereo</strong> appears. If there are three or more channels, just the number of channels appears.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_12">Data Size</h3>
<p>Shows the size of the waveform data after compression and conversion.<br />If the instrument references multiple waveform files (for example, a multi-region instrument), the total size of the reference files is shown.<br />The content on display is updated when files are converted.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_13">Original Key</h3>
<p>Specifies the original key for the region.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_14">Env A</h3>
<p>Envelopes can be set either per instrument or per region.<br />For a description of envelopes, see Instrument Parameters.</p>
<p>For multi-region instruments, specify the envelope's attack time in the range of <code>0</code> to <code>127</code> for the regions.<br />The same is true for each phase of the following envelope specifications.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_15">Env H</h3>
<p>Specifies the envelope hold time as a value in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>127</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_16">Env D</h3>
<p>Specifies the envelope decay time as a value in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>127</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_17">Env S</h3>
<p>Specifies the envelope sustain level as a value in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>127</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_18">Env R</h3>
<p>Specifies the envelope release time as a value in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>127</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_19">Volume</h3>
<p>Specifies the region volume as a value in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>255</code>.</p>
<p>If sound data volume is set to <code>127</code>, playback is at the same volume (1.0 times) as the source data.</p>
<p>However, volume can be set in many ways (data or program).<br />The result after all setting values are applied is clamped between 0.0 times and 2.0 times the source volume.<br />For more information, see Sound Parameter Control Operations in the <em>Sound System Manual</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_20">Pitch (Semitones)</h3>
<p>Specifies the pitch of the region, in semitones.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_21">Pitch (Cents)</h3>
<p>Specifies the pitch of the region, in cents (1 cent = 1/100th of a semitone).</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_22">Pan</h3>
<p>Specifies the pan for the region.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_23">Percussion Mode</h3>
<p>Specifies the percussion mode for the region.<br />When selected, it indicates that percussion mode is enabled.</p>
<p>In regions where percussion mode has been specified, the note-off command is ignored, and the wave file is played to the end regardless of the note length.<br />The pitch calculation that corresponds to the note height is performed in the usual manner.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Be careful when applying percussion mode to regions for which a looping wave file has been set. </strong>
</p>
<p>If percussion mode has been enabled for a loop wave, the following playback operations result.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notes continue playing because note off is not used.</li>
  <li>Release status is not entered because note off is not used.</li>
  <li>For this reason, the <strong>fix priority at release OFF setting</strong> is not actually accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This invites the following results.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because a note only stops when it loses priority, if the note is played at a high priority level, the number of notes that can be used decreases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_24">Key Group</h3>
<p>Specifies the key group for a region as a value in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>15</code>.</p>
<p>Operations are not performed for the key group when <code>0</code> is specified. Zero is set as the key group default.</p>
<p>In regions where the same nonzero key group has been set, each time a new note plays, playback of whatever is currently being played for the same key group stops.<br />This feature enables emulation of such effects as closed high hat and open high hat.</p>
<p>Key group operations are only enabled within the same track of a sequence.<br />If the same instrument is used from multiple sequences, or if the same instrument is used concurrently from multiple tracks within a sequence, the key group feature cannot be used.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956172_h3_25">Interpolation Type</h3>
<p>Specifies the interpolation type at the instrument level.</p>
<p>Configure the voice interpolation method. Select <strong>4-point interpolation</strong> or <strong>Linear interpolation</strong>. The default interpolation value is 4.</p>
<p>Currently, even if this interpolation type setting is changed, the change is not applied to the interpolation method.</p>
