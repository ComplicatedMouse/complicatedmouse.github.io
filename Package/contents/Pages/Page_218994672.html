<h2 id="Anchor_218994672_h2_1">1. Overview</h2>
<p>This page describes how to play multiple sounds at the same time, which can be useful when checking how sound effects sound over background music, for example.</p>
<p>In both SoundMaker and AtkPlayer, up to four different sounds can be played at the same time.</p>

    <p>This simultaneous playback refers to the ability to <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">playback in parallel</span>, and not to the ability to <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">begin simultaneous audio</span>.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_218994672_h2_3">3. Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_218994672_h3_3">Common</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_218994672_h4_3">Previously played sounds stop playing, or subsequently played sounds cannot be played.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>After the number of currently playing sounds exceeds the maximum, currently playing sounds may be stopped (according to sound priority), or you may be unable to play new sounds.  Check the player sound limit or the number of sounds setting in the sound archive in <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Project Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Sound Archive Settings Tab 1</strong>.</li>         　<li>If this happens when playing multiple sounds in AtkPlayer, check whether the single playback setting is enabled for the target sound in SoundMaker.  If the single playback setting is set to a value other than <strong>Do not use</strong>, you may be unable to play that sound at the same time as other sounds.</li></ul>
