    <a href="../Pages/Page_95685382.html">How the Libraries Are Provided and How to Use Them</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library is currently only provided for the NX.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_181896261_h1_3">Features Provided by the ec Library</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_181896261_h2_4">Utilities for Accessing eShop Services</h2>
<p>The following utilities for accessing eShop services are provided.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature for getting a list of titles and bundles including titles that are currently available for purchase on Nintendo eShop</li>
  <li>Feature for getting a list of downloadable content that is currently available on Nintendo eShop</li>
  <li>Feature for getting a list of consumable service items currently available on Nintendo eShop</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_181896261_h3_1">Getting Lists of Titles, Bundles Including Titles, Downloadable Content, and Consumable Service Items Currently Available on Nintendo eShop</h3>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library provides features for getting lists of products available on Nintendo eShop to make purchasing titles, bundles including titles, downloadable content, and consumable service items from within applications a smoother process.</p>
<p>The account library (<a href="../Pages/Page_108531698.html">account Library</a>) must be initialized in advance before using the features for getting lists of products on Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library provides only a means for accessing eShop services.<br />When actually getting lists of products on Nintendo eShop, you must be ready to refer not only to the SDK reference but also to the reference for the server that provides shop services.</p>
<p>In the <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">E-Commerce Guide</span>, see Features for Getting Information Within Application: Titles and Bundles Including Titles, Downloadable Content, and Consumable Service Items.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_181896261_h2_5">Feature to Jump to Nintendo eShop</h2>
<p>The following features are provided for jumping to Nintendo eShop.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature to jump to a screen listing and selling downloadable content currently being sold on Nintendo eShop</li>
  <li>Feature to jump to a screen listing and selling subscription service items currently being sold on Nintendo eShop</li>
  <li>Feature to jump to a screen listing and selling consumable service items that are currently being sold on Nintendo eShop.</li>

</ul>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>When jumping to the shop screen, you must have a user account associated with a Nintendo Account. The <code>ec</code> library performs this check before jumping to the shop. If the selected user account exists and has been associated with a Nintendo Account, that user account is used. <span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);">If no user account satisfies these conditions, or if the user account indicated by the value specified for the argument does not satisfy the conditions, the account management applet is called and prompts you to associate the user account with a Nintendo Account.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="Anchor_181896261_h3_2">Listing and Selling Downloadable Content, Subscription Service Items, and Consumable Service Items</h3>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library provides features for jumping to the eShop purchase screens to easily purchase certain downloadable content, subscription service items, and consumable service items from inside the application. This feature uses the ec applet, which is a library applet. You jump to the ec applet by calling a particular <code>ec</code> library function.</p>
<p>To use the jump feature to the shop purchase screen, you must have initialized the account library (<a href="../Pages/Page_108531698.html">account Library</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_181896261_h3_3">Displaying Detailed Application Information and Selling the Application</h3>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library also provides a feature to display the detailed information for the application itself, and jump to the screen where the application can be purchased. This feature is also provided by using the ec applet, and performs the jump by calling a specific function. For example, from the demo version of the application screen, you can specify the application ID of the retail version application and call <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__ec__ShowShopApplicationInformation">nn::ec::ShowShopApplicationInformation</span></code> to display the detailed information for the retail version of the application.</p>
<p>This feature also requires that the account library is initialized ahead of time.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_181896261_h3_4">Feature for providing consumable service items without an independent server</h3>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library provides a client library to enable the user save data controlled method, which is a method for providing consumable service items without an independent server.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_371425455.html">Consumable Service Items Client Libraries</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_181896261_h3_5">Feature for Detecting the Purchase of Products in the Shop</h3>
<p>The <code>ec</code> library provides a feature for detecting the purchase of products in the shop.<br />You can detect when subscription service items and consumable service items are purchased.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_181896261_h1_4">Other</h1>
<p>For an overview of the downloadable content, subscription service items, and consumable service items handled by the <code>ec</code> library, see the <em>E-Commerce Guide</em>. For more information about the <code>aoc</code> library that is used when using downloadable content inside the application, see <a href="../Pages/Page_162954314.html">aoc Library</a>.<br /></p>
<p>The feature to jump to the purchase screen uses the ec applet, which is a library applet. For an overview and specifications of library applets, see the section about library applets in the <em>System Features Guide</em>.</p>
