<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_1">NintendoWare includes platform-specific information.</h1>
<p>Although common packages are not supposed to depend on specific platforms, NintendoWare includes some platform-specific implementations, documentation, and samples.<br />These resources will be removed from the common package in future releases.</p>
<p>Note that the information about these resources is hard to use and understand in some parts of the package.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_2">Operation is not assured when the system locale is changed to anything other than the default value.</h1>
<p>The operation when the system locale is changed to anything other than the default value is not assured. (For example, if the locale is set to anything other than &quot;Japanese [Japan]&quot; in the Japanese version of Windows.)</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_3">Bugs Related to Visual Studio Help</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_1">If you try to uninstall the Documents package after uninstalling Visual Studio but with the Microsoft Help Viewer still installed, the uninstall will fail.</h2>
<p>If you try to uninstall the Nintendo SDK Documents package after uninstalling Visual Studio (any version) but with the Microsoft Help Viewer still installed, the uninstall will fail.</p>
<p>Uninstall Microsoft Help Viewer first, and then uninstall the package.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_2">The Find Result page for the NintendoSDK API Reference Manual does not work correctly in the Microsoft Help Viewer.</h2>
<p>The Find Result page for the NintendoSDK API Reference Manual does not work correctly in the Microsoft Help Viewer. If you try to use it, you cannot enter anything in the text box, making search impossible.</p>
<p>Use a web browser to use the Find Result page.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_3">When the Documents package is installed without an Internet connection, the Visual Studio Help format API reference is sometimes not installed.</h2>
<p>When the NintendoSDK Documents package is installed in an environment without an Internet connection, the installation succeeds, but sometimes the API reference cannot be viewed from the Microsoft Help Viewer.<br />This problem occurs because it cannot connect to the expiration server for the digital certificate and check the validity of the signature, so the Help file is not installed.</p>
<p>You can handle this problem by connecting to the Internet or by installing the intermediate certificate issued by an authority higher than the digital certificate (CN = DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID Code Signing CA) and then reinstalling the NintendoSDK Documents package.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_4">Bugs Related to HTCS</h1>
<p>When <code>htcs::Initialize</code> is called while Target Manager is not running, the function is blocked until a connection with Target Manager is established.</p>
<p>We plan to change this function in the future, so that the call is successful regardless of the connection status with Target Manager. </p>
<p>This bug prevents the following applications from starting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>EffectViewer</li>
  <li>LayoutViewer</li>
  <li>VfxCustomShader Sample</li>
  <li>G3dDemo Sample Edit Demo</li>
  <li>AtkViewer Sample</li>
  <li>NintendoWare AtkPlayer</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_5">audio Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_4">Exporting sound waveforms does not work in NintendoWare SoundMaker and SoundProjectWaveExporter.</h2>
<p>Attempts to export sound waveforms using the NintendoWare tools SoundMaker and SoundProjectWaveExporter always result in the creation of blank waveform files.</p>
<p>This problem is expected to be fixed by the next release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_5">When you convert a sound project imported using NintendoWare's SoundMaker, an invalid sound archive is exported.</h2>
<p>When, in SoundMaker, an NW4C/NW4F sound project (one for which the cache file remains for converting purposes) is imported and (normally) converted, NW4C/NW4F binary source files become mixed in with the NintendoSDK binary sound archive (BFSAR) files. As a result, they cannot be correctly read during the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> and <code>nw::snd</code> runtimes. This is a problem.</p>
<p> As a workaround to this problem, make sure to reconvert the sound project after importing it. This conversion makes the old cache file unusable.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_6">Some of the APIs for nn::atk do not work. </h2>
<p>
  <strong>APIs related to LowPassFilter do not work.</strong>
</p>
<p>APIs related to <code>LowPassFilter</code>, such as <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundHandle__SetLowPassFilterFrequency">nn::atk::SoundHandle::SetLowPassFilterFrequency</span>()</code>, can currently be set, but they are not applied.<br /><br />The <code>LowPassFilter</code> value set in SoundMaker is not applied either.<br /><code>BiquadFilter</code> can still be used, as before.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_7">If some of the parameters in Biquad filter are set, the audio may be cut off.</h2>
<p>If the following parameters are set in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundHandle__SetBiquadFilter">nn::atk::SoundHandle::SetBiquadFilter</span>()</code> or <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundPlayer__SetBiquadFilter">nn::atk::SoundPlayer::SetBiquadFilter</span>()</code>, audio from some sources may be cut off.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the filter in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__BiquadFilterType_LowPassFilter">nn::atk::BiquadFilterType_LowPassFilter</span></code> is selected and the value is set to <code>1.0</code></li>
  <li>When the filter in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__BiquadFilterType_HighPassFilter">nn::atk::BiquadFilterType_HighPassFilter</span></code> is selected and the value is set to <code>0.1</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_8">An exception is thrown when you start the NintendoWare AtkPlayer when there are no available playback devices.</h2>
<p>If AtkPlayer is started when there are no available playback devices on the PC, an exception is thrown, and the program halts. The workaround is to have a playback device available.</p>
<p>The problem that results in the exception being thrown is expected to be fixed in either the next release or the one after that.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_9">When playing a sound in NintendoWare AtkPlayer from NintendoWare SoundMaker, the SoundParameters panel values are not applied.</h2>
<p>When you connect SoundMaker and AtkPlayer and play a sound from SoundMaker in AtkPlayer, the values in the SoundParameters panel in AtkPlayer are not applied. However, if you change the values in the SoundParameters panel during playback, the changed parameters will be applied.</p>
<p>For example,if you play a sound from SoundMaker and then change <strong>Volume</strong> in the SoundParameters panel in AtkPlayer, the <strong>Volume</strong> value will be applied, but the other parameters remain at the default values, so there will be a gap between what is shown and the actual behavior.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_10">Sometimes effects are not processed in the order they were added in nn::audio.</h2>
<p>The intended specification is for effects to be processed in the order in which they were added to <code>SubMix</code> or <code>FinalMix</code>. However, if you have two or more effects registered to a single <code>SubMix</code> or <code>FinalMix</code>, and you then delete an effect and add another new effect, the effects sometimes run in the wrong order.</p>
<p>You can avoid this problem by deleting all effects from <code>SubMix</code> and <code>FinalMix</code> and then adding the effects.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_6">hid Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_11">An exception is thrown when the USB gamepad is detached during use in the Windows 8.1 environment.</h2>
<p>When the USB GamePad is removed during use in the Windows 8.1 environment, an exception is thrown and the program may stop.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_12">Accurate speed cannot be calculated for touching using Windows Touch Messages.</h2>
<p>When functions such as <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__hid__GetTouchScreenState">nn::hid::GetTouchScreenState</span>()</code> read the touch status using Windows Touch Messages, the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__hid__TouchState__deltaTime">nn::hid::TouchState::deltaTime</span></code> value does not consider the report rate and becomes a simple sampling interval.</p>
<p>Based on this, if the touch moving speed is calculated using this value, a value around the actual speed may be obtained as a result.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_7">ui2d Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_13">Cannot use Render in two cycles under Special border format in the Text Box Pane.</h2>
<p>In this package, the runtime does not support the <strong>Text Box Pane</strong> &gt; <strong>Special border format</strong> &gt; <strong>Render in two cycles</strong> option, so it cannot be used.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_14">Alpha Test does not work.</h2>
<p>Alpha Test does not work in this package.</p>
<p>This problem is expected to be fixed by the next release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_15">Texture display cannot be performed correctly for LayoutViewer in some graphics driver environments.</h2>
<p>In some graphics driver environments, the textures in LayoutViewer are not displayed correctly. (We have seen this bug in the Quadro2000 driver 341.05 environment.)</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_16">The G3dDemo Edit demo is not displayed correctly in Visual Studio 2013 Release build.</h2>
<p>When you run the Visual Studio 2013 Win32/x64 Release build for the G3dDemo Edit demo, the aspect ratio is not calculated correctly when rendering, and the display of the demo is corrupted.</p>
<p>Either set the compiler optimization options in the Visual Studio project file properties to disabled (<code>/Od</code>), or build in something other than Visual Studio 2013 Release build.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_17">Material animation files exported by the NintendoWare 3D tool have the same name.</h2>
<p>The NintendoWare <a href="../Pages/Page_83955997.html">3D Binary Converter</a> has restrictions against converting shader parameter animations (FSP files), texture pattern animations (FTP files), texture SRT animations (FTS files), material visibility animations (FVM files), or color animations (FCL files) with the same name simultaneously. However, the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955629.html">Maya Export Plug-In</a> and <a href="../Pages/Page_83955545.html">3dsMax Export Plug-In</a> export intermediate files with the same name as the models.</p>
<p>Also, when creating a new animation for a model from <a href="../Pages/Page_83955978.html">3DEditor</a>, the default name is the same as the model.</p>
<p>When collecting these animation files with the same name into one binary file for conversion, change the names of the intermediate files before converting.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_18">An assertion failure occurs when an application with nn::g3d::viewer embedded and 3DEditor are connected, and the sample parameter filtering settings are edited in 3DEditor.</h2>
<p>An assertion failure occurs in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__g3d__viewer">nn::g3d::viewer</span></code> when an application with <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__g3d__viewer">nn::g3d::viewer</span></code> embedded and 3DEditor are connected, and the sample parameter filtering settings are edited in 3DEditor.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_19">An assertion failure occurs when an application with nn::g3d::viewer embedded and 3DEditor are connected, and the camera animation parameters for a scene animation are edited.</h2>
<p>An assertion failure occurs in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__g3d__viewer">nn::g3d::viewer</span></code> when an application with <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__g3d__viewer">nn::g3d::viewer</span></code> embedded and 3DEditor are connected, and the camera animation parameters for a scene animation are edited.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_20">3DEditor sometimes crashes when changing the platform.</h2>
<p>When the platform is changed while the <strong>Property Window</strong> is open in 3DEditor, 3DEditor sometimes crashes.</p>
<p>Close the <strong>Property Window</strong> before changing the platform.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_107317217_h2_21">In the GL version, textures with a width that is not a multiple of 4 bytes are not initialized correctly.</h2>
<p>When initializing textures in the GL version, if the width is not a multiple of 4 bytes, the texture is not initialized correctly, and the content is corrupted and initialized.<br />For example, for a texture with image format <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__gfx__ImageFormat_R8_G8">nn::gfx::ImageFormat_R8_G8</span></code> and width 7, the width is 14 bytes, so this problem occurs.</p>

<p>Batch processing fails when building the sample demo that performs batch processing if <code>()</code> is included in the path to the NintendoSDK. You can avoid this problem by not using <code>()</code> in the NintendoSDK path.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_14">Response is slow when using the mouse wheel to scroll on the Nintendo Dev Interface Environment Structure screen.</h1>
<p>We have received reports that the response is slow when using the mouse wheel to scroll on the Nintendo Dev Interface Environment Structure screen in some PC environments.</p>
<p>If this problem occurs, please use the scrollbar instead of the mouse wheel to scroll.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107317217_h1_15">Sometimes there is no response when deleting an environment in Nintendo Dev Interface.</h1>
<p>When the separately installed Nintendo TargetManager is running, environment deletion processing may stop running.</p>
