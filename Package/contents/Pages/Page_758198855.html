<div class="text_separate">
<p>The <strong>Home</strong> tab contains the primary profiler operations for connecting to the dev kit and manipulating the&nbsp;profiles.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198855_h1_1">Connection Group</h1>
<p>The <strong>Sync</strong> button allows you to connect to a dev kit. Pressing this button starts the&nbsp;following two step synchronization process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Selection of a dev kit. If only one dev kit is available that kit will be connected to automatically. If more&nbsp;than one kit is available, a window appears with a list of available dev kits.</li>
  <li>The <a href="../Pages/Page_758198785.html">Scenario Selection</a> window appears and asks how to connect to your game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the sync process has completed, the <strong>Start</strong> profile button and the <strong>Unsync</strong> button will become active.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>Unsync</strong> button if you want to profile a different executable or if you want to connect to a different&nbsp;dev kit.</p>
<p>Current connection information is shown in the <strong>Status Bar</strong> at the bottom left of the application.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198855_h1_2">File Group</h1>
<p>The <strong>Open</strong> button allows you to open a previously saved profile.</p>
<p>The <strong>Save</strong> button saves the current profile.</p>
<p>The <strong>Script</strong> button loads and runs scripts that can automate profiling. See the&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_758198826.html">Scripting</a> section for more information.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198855_h1_3">Help Group</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_1">Readme</h2>
<p>The <strong>Readme</strong> button opens the readme that explains how to quickly configure your game to be profiled. It also contains the official change log for the profiler GUI and library.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_2">Manual</h2>
<p>The <strong>Manual</strong> button opens this manual.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198855_h1_4">Units Group</h1>
<p>These buttons select the units used to represent the amount of time spent in each function. The selected units are reflected in any tab that shows profile data, such as the <strong>Functions&nbsp;</strong>tab, the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab, or in the tool tips of the <strong>Timeline</strong> tab. The majority of users will be most comfortable with <strong>Percent</strong>, but it might be insightful to view the data in another type of unit. For example, the unit of <strong>Samples</strong> is the actual number of samples that was recorded for each function (all other units are derived from samples).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_3">Percent Mode</h2>
<p>This is the percent of time the function ran compared with all other functions during the selected time&nbsp;period. For example, if a function was sampled 100 times out of 400 total samples, then 25% of the&nbsp;execution time was spent in this function. <strong>Percent</strong> is useful when comparing relative function times. Enable&nbsp;the <strong>Error</strong> button in order to see the margin of error on the values.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_4">Time Mode</h2>
<p>This is an approximation of the time spent in each function (the approximation is calculated with statistics&nbsp;and is not directly measured using a timer). If one or more frames are selected or a period of time is&nbsp;selected, then the time is an estimate over that selection. If frames or times are not selected, then the time&nbsp;is an estimate over the entire duration of the profile.</p>
<p>Please be aware that&nbsp;<strong>Time</strong>&nbsp;will be more accurate if you use a very low sampling rate over a very long&nbsp;period of time, due to profiler overhead.</p>
<p>To see how long a function took on average per frame, use the <strong>Avg</strong> mode.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_5">Avg Mode</h2>
<p>This is an approximation of the time spent in each function <em>divided by the number of frames</em>. If no frames&nbsp;exist for a given core, then this is the same as the <strong>Time</strong> mode (nothing is averaged). If the core has frames,&nbsp;but none are selected, then time is divided by the total number of recorded frames on that core. If the core&nbsp;has selected frames, then time represents the time on those selected frames divided by the number of&nbsp;currently selected frames. Enable the <strong>Error</strong> button to see the margin of error.</p>
<p>Use&nbsp;<strong>Avg</strong>&nbsp;to understand how long a function actually executed, which can be useful if you want to stay&nbsp;within a particular time budget or frame rate. Please be aware that&nbsp;<strong>Avg</strong>&nbsp;will be more accurate if you use a very low sampling rate over a very long&nbsp;period of time. As profiler overhead increases,&nbsp;<strong>Avg</strong>&nbsp;will become less accurate, so a low sampling rate&nbsp;is critical if you want to use this metric. Also, be aware that selecting individual frames will decrease the&nbsp;precision/accuracy as the margin of error will increase. Enable the&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;button to see the margin of error&nbsp;(note that this error calculation does not take into account profiler overhead, just statistical variation).</p>
<p>Note: With <strong>Avg</strong> selected, the sorting in the <strong>Total</strong> and <strong>Self</strong> columns in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab may&nbsp;appear wrong. This happens because the functions on different cores are divided by a different&nbsp;number of frames, yet the sorting is based on importance (absolute time). However, sorting is&nbsp;correct for all functions on a given core (sorting is correct if filtered by core).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_6">Samples Mode</h2>
<p>This provides the actual number of samples taken in a function. This is the basic unit that the above units&nbsp;are calculated from. Enable the <strong>Error</strong> button to see the margin of error.</p>
<p>Note: <strong>Samples</strong> mode is not the number of times the function is called. It is the number of times the function was sampled.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_7">Error Toggle</h2>
<p>This button is independent of the other <strong>Units</strong> buttons. It controls whether or not the margin of error is&nbsp;displayed next to the <strong>Percent</strong>, <strong>Time</strong>, <strong>Avg</strong>, or <strong>Samples</strong> values. The margin of error is useful to determine&nbsp;the precision of the results. For example, if a single frame is selected, the margin of error tends to be very&nbsp;large. As a result, the <strong>Percent</strong> or <strong>Time</strong> values may look precise (for example, 8.2%), but the margin of&nbsp;error can tell you the exact precision (for example, &plusmn;5.8%), which is important when comparing values or&nbsp;assessing performance. The <strong>Error</strong> button's state is saved in the profiler's settings so that it will remember&nbsp;the last selected state when you relaunch the profiler.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;The margin of error calculation does not take into account profiler overhead, just statistical variation.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198855_h1_5">Settings Group</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198855_h2_8">Options</h2>
<p>The <strong>Options</strong> button opens a new window that contains various settings used in the profiler. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_758198803.html">Options Window</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
