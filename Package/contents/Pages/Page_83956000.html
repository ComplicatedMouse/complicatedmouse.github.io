<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_8">Included Letter Order Files</h3>
<p>FontConverter includes the character order file. ( Tools/Graphics/FontConverter/xlor )<br /> The included files are ones with 16 horizontal characters and ones with 94 horizontal characters.<br /> They are the same other than spaces added to adjust the arrangement.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_9">Considerations When Creating the Character Order File</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_2">Version 1.1 Is Recommended</h4>
<p>When <code>1.0</code> is specified in the version attribute for the letter-order element, a character order file that has the same character code specified multiple times can be created.<br /> However, this specification is not recommended, as problems can easily occur because several glyphs correspond to the same character code.<br /> By specifying <code>1.1</code> in the version attribute, an error may occur for duplicate specifications.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_3">Code Duplication With Unicode</h4>
<p>In FontConverter, Unicode determines whether a character code is duplicated.<br /> The 16 characters in the table are character codes in different character sets, but in Unicode they are the same character code, which is a problem.<br /> To avoid this problem, the 16 characters on the Shift JIS side in the included character order file (<code>cp1252_JIS_X0201_X0208_012.xlor</code>) are replaced with .</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_83956000_h2_5">Glyph Group File (XGGP File)</h2>
<p>The glyph group file defines the glyph group collection (group set). It has been discontinued because the archive fonts have been discontinued.</p>

  <a name="Anchor_83956000_picture"></a>
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956000_h2_6">Image Format</h2>
<p>The images handled by FontConverter have two structures called blocks and cells.<br /> The image comprises a grid of blocks without intervening spaces, and each block comprises a cell.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_10">Blocks</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_4">BMP Image Example</h4>
<p>In the image, several blocks, specified as width x height in the character order file, are arranged without any spaces.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955990/83080087.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_5">Block Scheme</h4>
<p>Each block includes a cell and a width line. The figure shows a block scheme 14 pixels wide and 16 pixels high. The thick solid line shows the boundaries of the block, and the thin dashed lines show the boundaries of each pixel.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955990/83080088.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_6">Grid Area</h4>
<p>The interior one-pixel region of the block boundary is called the grid area. In the figure, this region is the portion following the block boundary that is shaded in dark gray.<br /> When <strong>Render Grid</strong> is selected during <code>Image</code> output, a grid area is constructed with a two-pixel wide grid matching the grid area of adjacent blocks that have been filled with the grid color.<br /> If <strong>Render Grid</strong> has not been selected, it is filled with the background color.<br /> During <code>Image</code> input, this grid area is simply ignored.</p>
<p>
  <a name="Anchor_83956000_margin_area"></a>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_7">Margin Area</h4>
<p>The one-pixel area around the inside of the grid area is called the margin area.<br /> This area is set so that the grid and cell or width lines do not touch. There is also a one-pixel margin area between the cell and the width line region.<br /> When <strong>Render Grid</strong> is selected during <code>Image</code> output, the margin area is filled with the margin color. If not selected, it is filled with the background color.<br /> During <code>Image</code> input, this area is checked to determine whether it is filled with a single color. If two or more colors are detected, a warning is displayed because a glyph may be protruding.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_8">Cell</h4>
<p>The upper interior of the margin area is called the cell. The cell is the render area for the glyph image, and the glyph image is rendered in this region.<br /> <br /> Because the height of the width line is fixed to one pixel, the cell size is always:<br /> <br /> Cell Width = Block Width - 4 pixels<br /> Cell Height = Block Height - 6 pixels<br /> <br /> .</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_9">Width Line Region</h4>
<p>The lower interior of the margin area is called the width line, and a one-pixel thick line is rendered in this region.<br /> It defines the width of the text character and the relative location of the glyph image.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_11">Cells and Width Lines</h3>
<p>The figure on the left shows a pattern diagram for a width line region and a cell with a width of 10 pixels and a height of 10 pixels.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955990/83080086.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <a name="Anchor_83956000_glyphimage"></a>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_10">Glyph Images</h4>
<p>The glyph image is the only thing placed inside the cell. FontConverter detects the smallest rectangles in the cell that have nonzero alpha values or non-white pixels, and then treats them as the grid image. Even if the cell is large, the white transparent portions surrounding the glyph image are ignored and do not affect the font to be output. For example, in the left figure, the glyph image is extracted as a rectangular image with a width of 5 pixels and a height of 7 pixels. (See the right figure.)</p>
<p>Note that when the image does not include an alpha channel, the smallest rectangle that includes non-white pixels is treated as the glyph image. If the glyph image is located in the same relative location as the width line, it does not matter whether it is located on the left or right side of the cell. For example, in either case shown in the following figure, the same font is output.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955990/83080079.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Similar rules are applied to the width line region, grid area, and margin area for the alpha channel.<br /> For example, for an image that includes alpha, if alpha is not set to <code>0</code> for the width line region, the width of the entire width line region is interpreted incorrectly as the character width.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_11">Width Line</h4>
<p>A single line is drawn in the width line area. The width line prescribes both the width of the character and the width of the empty space to the left and right of the character. If the line is broken into two segments, an error occurs.</p>
<p>Because the length of the width line defines the text character width, the text character width can be set to be narrower than the glyph image. The character width can be made smaller than the width of the glyph image. In this case, it is displayed overlapping with the preceding character on the actual hardware. In the previous figure, the character width is seven pixels.</p>
<p>The left space width is the difference between the left end of the width line and the left edge of the glyph image. When rendering characters with the character rendering library, the glyph is rendered with a space left for the width of the left space. In the previous figure, the left space is one pixel, and a five-pixel wide glyph is rendered one pixel to the right of the coordinate specified when rendering the character.</p>
<p>Like the left space width, the right space width is the difference between the right end of the width line and the right edge of the glyph image. In the previous figure, the right space is one pixel.</p>
<p>
  <a name="Anchor_83956000_not_output_glyph"></a>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_12">Glyphs With NoOutput</h4>
<p>If the glyph image size is <code>0</code> and the width of the width line is also <code>0</code>, or if the interior of the cell is filled with a single color and the width of the width line is <code>0</code>, that glyph is not passed to output.</p>
<p>You can use this to control the glyphs to output without using a character filter. Conversely, if a glyph that has been specified to be output with the character filter is not passed to output, a warning is displayed because there is a chance that a character may be unintentionally omitted.</p>
<p>
  <a name="Anchor_83956000_placement"></a>
</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_12">Placement Information</h3>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955990/83080078.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>In the upper-left block of the image, several one-pixel points are included. These points specify the value that is the basis for placing a string when rendering a string. The values that are the basis for placement are the baseline, ascender line, descender line, and font width. They are specified with five points.</p>
<p>These values are common to all fonts, and cannot be specified for each font.</p>
<p>All points exist in the grid area and appear in white (255, 255, 255) if the grid is drawn and appear in the grid color if the grid is not drawn. The pixel indicating the baseline position must exist, but the other four points can be omitted. The pixel at the upper left of the image is reserved for future use and must be white (255, 255, 255). This pixel can also be used as the clear color. When an alpha value is input, the clear color is determined as a color that includes an alpha value.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_13">Baseline</h4>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955990/83080077.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>The baseline position is indicated by a single point and exists in the region on the left side of the grid area.<br /> The top edge of this pixel is the baseline position. In other words, the baseline is the space between pixels.<br /> The baseline is the standard position in the vertical direction when using a mix of different fonts or when performing scaling.</p>
<p>
  <a name="Anchor_83956000_ascenders_descenders"></a>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_14">Ascender Line, Descender Line</h4>
<p>The ascender line and the descender line are each indicated by a single point and exist in the region on the left side of the grid area.</p>
<p>Both the ascender line and the descender line are between pixels. The ascender line is the position at the bottom edge of the pixel indicating the ascender line, and the descender line is the position at the top edge of the pixel indicating the descender line.</p>
<p>The ascender line must be positioned above the baseline, and the descender line must be positioned below the baseline. The pixel indicating the descender line position can overlap the pixel indicating the baseline position. In this case, the descent is <code>0</code>. For this reason, ascent and descent are values greater than 0.</p>
<p>These points can be omitted, and analysis is performed according to the number of points, as shown in the table. When there is a single point, when neither the ascender line position nor the descender line position are specified, the top edge of the cell is treated as the ascender line and the bottom edge of the cell is treated as the descender line.</p>

<p>With images output by FontConverter, there are cases when the pixels indicating the ascender line position and the descender line positions are rendered and cases when they are not. They are not usually rendered with the conversion using Windows fonts as input; they are normally rendered with conversion using BFFNT as input. When using an <code>Image</code> as input, they are rendered when the input image contains pixels indicating the ascender line position and the descender line position, and they are not rendered if not included. When the pixels indicating the ascender line position and the descender line position are rendered, if the cell size of the image to output is too small to express those pixels, the cell size is automatically increased.</p>
<p>The ascender line is treated as the top edge of the string; the descender line is treated as the bottom edge of the string. The distance between the ascender line and descender line is called the font height, and is the base size when scaling in the vertical direction.</p>

<p>The font width is indicated by two points and exists in the region at the top of the grid area. The two points indicate the left edge and right edge of the width, respectively. The number of pixels that are sandwiched between these two pixels is the font width. If the number of sandwiched pixels is the same, the left or right position of the point does not have an effect.</p>
<p>When the points indicating the font width are omitted, the cell width is treated as the font width. If not omitted, two points must exist.</p>
<p>With images output by FontConverter, sometimes the pixels indicating the font width are rendered and sometimes they are not. They are not usually rendered with the conversion using Windows fonts as input. Typically, they are rendered with conversion using BCFNT as input. When using an <code>Image</code> as input, they are rendered when the input image contains pixels indicating the font width, and they are not rendered if not included. When the pixels indicating the font width are rendered, if the cell size of the image to output is too small to express those pixels, the cell size is automatically increased.</p>
<p>The font width is the base size when scaling in the horizontal direction and for tab widths.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_83956000_h2_7">Image File Format</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_13">Output Image Files</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_16">BMP</h4>
<p>BMP output with FontConverter is direct color BMP with 32 bits per pixel (RGBA8). The resolution is set to 72 dpi.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_17">TGA</h4>
<p>TGA output with FontConverter is run-length compressed TrueColor format TGA with 32 bits per pixel (RGBA8). The 16-byte &quot;FontConverter output.&quot; is set as the image ID.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_18">TIFF</h4>
<p>In FontConverter, data that was output to BMP is converted to TIFF.</p>
<p>
  <a name="Anchor_83956000_possible_input"></a>
</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_14">Image Files That Can Be Input</h3>
<p>Image files passed to FontConverter have the following common limitations: block width x number of blocks in the horizontal direction = image width, and block height x number of blocks in the vertical direction = image height. In other words, blocks in the image must be arranged without spaces, and no margins are allowed. In actuality, the character order file determines the number of blocks in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the image file determines the width and height of the image. Then the block width and height are calculated. Both the width and the height must be integer values.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_19">BMP</h4>
<p>In FontConverter, you can input BMP files that are either index color BMP files with 1, 4, or 8 bits (2, 16, or 256 colors) per pixel; or direct color BMP files with 24 bits (RGB8) or 32 bits (RGBA8) per pixel.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_20">TGA</h4>
<p>You can input TGA files that are either 24-bit (RGB8) or 32-bit (RGBA8) palette index color (ColorMap) format TGA files with 8 or 16 bits (256 or 65536 colors) per pixel, or direct color (TrueColor) format TGA files with 24 bits (RGB8) or 32 bits (RGBA8) per pixel. Both file types support run-length compression and no compression.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83956000_h4_21">TIFF</h4>
<p>FontConverter converts TIFF files to BMP files, and then inputs them.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956000_h3_15">Handling Intensity Format Fonts</h3>
<p>With intensity format fonts, the luminance value of the glyph image in the image file is inverted. Luminance is higher when a pixel is closer to black, and lower when a pixel is closer to white.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956000_h2_8">Kerning Definition File (BFFKN)</h2>
<p>This file format stores information about kerning (correction values that adjust character spacing).<br /> It is output from Windows fonts that have kerning information at the same time as the output of the image format by the font converter.<br /> When you create a font binary that has kerning information from the image file, place a BFFKN file with the same name before the extension in the same folder as the image file.</p>
