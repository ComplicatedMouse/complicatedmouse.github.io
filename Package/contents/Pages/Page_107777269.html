<p>This section describes the basic ways of using the NX Add-On for developing NX applications.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107777269_h1_1">Building and Running the Samples</h1>
<p>For information about building and running the samples included in the NX Add-On package, see <a href="../Pages/Page_109314436.html">Quick Start</a>.</p>
<p>To run the sample applications on the SDEV and EDEV development hardware, you must first prepare the hardware as described in <a href="../Pages/Page_107781392.html">Initializing the SDEV</a> / <a href="../Pages/Page_126561209.html">Initializing the EDEV</a>.</p>
<p>You must have a dedicated driver already installed to run the sample applications that use the graphics features on Windows. For the detailed procedure, see Installing the GPU Driver in <a href="../Pages/Page_87937845.html">nvn Library</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107777269_h1_2">Creating an NX Application Project</h1>
<p>Use NX Add-On to create a project file for the development of your NX application.<br />You can also configure an existing project file so it is set for an NX application.<br />For a detailed procedure, see <a href="../Pages/Page_107779263.html">Creating New Projects</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107777269_h1_3">Developing an NX Application</h1>
<p>NX Add-On allows you to develop NX applications using the NX API set.<br />By changing the platform that is the build target for your NX application, you can use basically the same code to debug and run the application in both the Windows environment and on the NX development hardware.<br />For a detailed procedure, see <a href="../Pages/Page_107779298.html">Application Development</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107777269_h1_4">Installing and Running an NX Application on the Development Hardware</h1>
<p>You can test the NX application you have developed without connecting to a host PC by installing and running it on the development hardware.<br />For a detailed procedure, see <a href="../Pages/Page_107779320.html">Installing Applications on Development Hardware</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_107777269_h1_5">Writing NX Applications to NX Development Cards, and Running Applications From NX Development Cards</h1>
<p>NX applications can be written to and executed from NX development cards to test applications without needing to connect to a host PC.<br />For a detailed procedure, see <a href="../Pages/Page_166051528.html">Writing to NX Development Cards</a>.</p>
