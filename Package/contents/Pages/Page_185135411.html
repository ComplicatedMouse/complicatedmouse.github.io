<h1 id="Anchor_185135411_h1_1">Overview</h1>
<p>This section describes patch development procedures as envisioned by Nintendo.</p>
<p>It is intended for reference purposes, because compliance with these procedures is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135411_h1_2">Building and Debugging the Revised Application</h1>
<p>The first step is to build and debug the revised application, paying no heed to the patch. You can use VSI or another tool to create the revised application.</p>
<p>With the exception of storage access speed, you can assume that the revised application is the same as the initial application plus the patch. For this reason, you can use the revised application for testing except where speed is affected.</p>
<p>It is possible to verify the compatibility of save data from the initial application here. In some cases, starting the application might be restricted by required version settings when switching between the initial application and revised application to verify compatibility. If a restriction is encountered, reset the required version using <a href="../Pages/Page_424117414.html">DevMenuCommand</a>. When switching between application versions again, the save data created by the revised application will be loaded into the initial application. If this is undesirable, also delete the save data.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135411_h1_3">Building and Debugging the Patch</h1>
<p>To test the effect on speed and to conduct QA testing on the product that will be ultimately submitted, you must build and debug the patch. In addition, the size of a patch is limited, so you must build the patch to make sure it fits within the limit. For more information about patch size, see the Patch Guide.</p>
<p>For more information about building a patch and debugging using the created patch, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135488.html">Building and Running a Patch</a>. The patch affects the load speed, so if there is a previous patch make sure that you specify that patch.</p>
<p>A patch cannot currently be started from VSI after it has been optimized. However, after you start the patch using the method described in <a href="../Pages/Page_185135488.html">Building and Running a Patch</a>, you can attach the patch to VSI for debugging. For more information about attaching a patch after it has been started, see <a href="../Pages/Page_126569850.html">Debugging a Built Program</a> &gt; Debugging an Already Running Application.</p>
<p>If there are plans to produce NX cards with on-card patches, make sure to verify the operation of the NX development card with an on-card patch.</p>
