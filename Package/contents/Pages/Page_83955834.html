<h2 id="Anchor_83955834_h2_1">Terminology Definitions</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_1">Pan Mode</h3>
<p>There are several types of pan operations on a stereo waveform. These types of pan operations are called pan modes.</p>
<p>Pan Mode specification is valid setting only for stereo materials.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_2">Balance Pan</h3>
<p>One type of pan mode, referring to the operation to adjust the volume balance between the stereo right and left channels. Balance pan performs the same operation as normal pan performed on monaural materials, so no volume difference with monaural is generated.</p>
<p>It is used in stream sounds, for example, and is applied to materials that have already been mixed down as stereo.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_3">Dual Pan</h3>
<p>One type of pan mode, referring to the operation to adjust the volume balance between the stereo right and left channels independently as two independent monaural voices.. With dual pan, for example, when the pan is changed to the left, the sound from the right channel is also output to the left channel.</p>
<p>It is used to forcibly apply pan to a material that is a wave sound being stereo sampled.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_4">Pan Curve</h3>
<p>This refers to the type of attenuation curve for the volume used when determining the right and left volume.</p>
<p>Pan Curve specification is enabled for both stereo and monaural materials, and the settings are also applied to surround pan operations.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955834_h2_2">Operational Specifications</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_5">Pan Operations on Stereo Waveforms</h3>
<p>Pan operations on stereo waveforms output the left channel to the left speaker and the right channel to the right speaker when the pan is positioned in the center, and the sound for each channel is not mixed.</p>
<p>This central operation is shared by the pan mode, and when pan is moved between right and left, the operation by pan mode is different.</p>
<p>This section describes the difference in operation when pan is moved using an example of moving the pan to the right.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955834_h4_1">Balance Pan Operation</h4>
<p>The volume of the left channel is lowered and the volume of the right channel is raised, or the volume in the center is maintained.<br /> Only the volume of the right and left channel is changed, and the position itself is not changed.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955834_h4_2">Dual Pan Operation</h4>
<p>The pan of the left channel is moved to the right, and the volume of the right channel is not changed.</p>
<p>As a result, the left channel sound is also played from the right channel.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_6">Pan Mode Settings</h3>
<p>Pan Mode settings are performed at the level of stream sounds and wave sounds with SoundMaker.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_7">Pan Curve Types and Settings</h3>
<p>Pan Curve settings are performed at the level of stream sounds and wave sounds with SoundMaker.</p>
<p>The curve type is selected from square root, trigonometric functions, and linear. Curves can enable or disable further volume attenuation at the center and can set clamp to clamp the increase of volume from the center to the center value.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_8">NW4F Compatibility Mode Pan Curve</h3>
<p>The <code>atk</code> library pan curve differs from the NW4F pan curve during output with surround sound.<br />For this reason, a mechanism has been prepared that allows you to switch the pan curve to NW4F compatibility mode.</p>
<p>When NW4F compatibility mode is active, it changes to a pan curve like the following.<br />This change occurs only with pan, so pan curve changes do not occur with surround pan.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83955834_h3_9">Relationship Between Pan Mode/Pan Curve Type and Loudness</h3>
<p>Depending on the pan mode and pan curve settings, the loudness when sounds are played at the same volume in the application, may differ from the loudness values of the original waveforms.</p>
<p>If SoundMaker has been configured to play sounds with the equal volume set at 127, the compression format set to PCM16, and pan not applied, configure the pan mode and pan curve as follows if you want the loudness to match that of the original waveforms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For a mono sound source: <code>Sqrt(-3dB), SinCos(-3dB)</code> for the optional pan mode</li>
  <li>For a stereo sound source: <code>Sqrt(0dB), SinCos(0dB), Linear(0dB)</code> for the balance pan (clamp can be set to clamp or not clamp) or <code>Sqrt(-3dB), SinCos(-3dB)</code> for the dual pan.</li>
