<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_83955638">Sequence Sounds</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_83955638_h1_1">Sequence Sounds</h1>
<p>Select the <strong>Sequence Sound</strong> node in the project tree to show the sequence sounds on the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab.<br />The list that appears is called the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955638_h2_1">Creating and Adding Sequence Sounds</h2>
<p>To create or add a sequence sound, on the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab, select the list, and then select <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Item</strong> &gt; <strong>Sequence Sound</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also create or add a sequence sound by right-clicking the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong> and using the shortcut menu that appears.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955638_h2_2">Editing Sequence Sounds</h2>
<p>Sequence sounds are edited from the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong>.<br />The columns in the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong> show the defined elements that are essential to the sequence sound. They correspond to the elements that are essential for the sequence sound data in the sound archive.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955638_h2_3">Elements of a Sequence Sound List</h2>
<p>This section describes the meanings of the defined elements in the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_1">Play</h3>
<p>Clicking this button registers the selected sound in the <strong>Preview Player</strong> window, and triggers playback of the sequence sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_2">Name</h3>
<p>Specifies the name of a sequence sound.<br />Programs use this name to play the sequence sound through the <code>atk</code> library from the sound archive that is ultimately created.</p>
<p>The characters that can be used in a name are restricted. The following characters can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9_] for subsequent characters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_3">File Type</h3>
<p>Select the type of reference file.<br />Select <strong>SMF</strong> when using a standard MIDI file or <strong>text</strong> when using a text sequence file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_4">File path</h3>
<p>Specifies the file to reference when creating a sequence sound.</p>
<p>The characters that can be used in a filename or path name are restricted. The following characters can be used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character of the filename.</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _] for subsequent characters in the filename.</li>
</ul>
<p>To open the file that the file path specifies, right-click the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong> and select <strong>Open reference file</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_5">Starting Playback Position</h3>
<p>When you use a text sequence file as a reference file, specify the sequence label that plays in the sequence sound.</p>
<p>If you do not specify a sequence label, the very first sequence in the text sequence file plays.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_6">Bank</h3>
<p>Specifies the bank to use when playing a sequence sound.</p>
<p>If the bank the sequence sound item references is a single bank, you can open the bank file being referenced on the <strong>Bank</strong> tab by right-clicking the Sequence Sound List and selecting <strong>Open Reference Bank</strong> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_7">Multibank Settings</h3>
<p>You can specify multiple banks when working with sequence sounds.<br />Up to a maximum of four banks can be set for a single sequence sound.<br />Create a multibank by specifying banks for bank 1 through bank 3.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_8">Player</h3>
<p>Specifies the player to use when voicing a sequence sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_9">Volume</h3>
<p>Specifies the volume (in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>255</code>) to use when the <code>Atk</code> library plays the sequence sound.</p>
<p>If sound data volume is set to <code>127</code>, playback is at the same volume (1.0 times) as the source data.</p>
<p>However, volume can be set in many ways (data or program).<br />The result after all setting values are applied is clamped between 0.0 times and 2.0 times the source volume.<br />For more information, see Sound Parameter Control Operations in the <em><a href="../Pages/Page_83955829.html">Sound System Manual</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_10">Average Loudness Value</h3>
<p>To display the average loudness value, you can right-click an item and select <strong>Measure average loudness value</strong> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_11">Channel Priority</h3>
<p>Specifies the channel priority of the sequence sound as a value from 0 through 127.<br />The higher the value, the higher the priority.</p>
<p>This value is added to the sound priority that is set for each channel in the sequence file that is referenced. The result is the final sound priority for each voice when it sounds.<br />To read how to set the sound priority for sequence files, see the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956104.html">Sequence Data Manual</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_12">Player Priority</h3>
<p>Specifies the player priority of the sequence sound as a value from 0 through 127.<br />The higher the value, the higher the priority.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Player Priority</strong> indicates which sounds to play (or stop) when the player attempts to play more than its sound limit, or more than the maximum number of sounds and tracks as configured in the system settings.<br />For more information, see the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956106.html">Sound System Manual</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_13">Actor Players</h3>
<p>The values <code>0</code> through <code>3</code> represent the four types of actor players to play.</p>
<p>Because actor players correspond to a real-world sound source or, specifically, the vocal chords of a particular voice, you can limit the number of sounds that can be played at the same time for each actor player.<br />Just as with a player, if the specified number of sounds is exceeded, the player priority set for each sound is compared, and the sound with the lowest priority is stopped.<br />The initial value of the number of restricted sounds for each actor player is unlimited for actor player number <code>0</code>, and <code>1</code> for actor player numbers <code>1</code> through <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Actor players are mainly used in conjunction with 3D sound actors.<br />As an example, use actor players when you want to suppress the playback of a sound at the actor level in situations where the same sound might be played simultaneously by multiple 3D sound actors.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_14">Single Playback</h3>
<p>Specifies the control mode for single playback.</p>
<p>Use <strong>Single playback</strong> to control playback so only one instance of a particular sound is played at the same time on the same player. You can specify any of the five following modes as the control method to control what happens when a particular sound is playing and the same sound plays once.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do nothing (the default)<br />The playing instance of the sound and the new instance of the sound both play.</li>
  <li>Last note priority<br />The playing sound stops and the new instance of the sound plays.</li>
  <li>Last note within time priority<br />The same controls as those from <strong>Last note priority</strong> are applied if the time that has elapsed since the start of the first sound falls within the period specified in the <strong>Single playback time</strong> column. Controls are same as when single playback is not used when outside the time.</li>
  <li>First note priority<br />The playing sound continues to play and the new instance of the sound fails to play.</li>
  <li>First note within time priority<br />The same controls as those from <strong>First note priority</strong> are applied if the time that has elapsed since the start of the first sound falls within the period specified in the <strong>Single playback time</strong> column. Controls are same as when single playback is not used when outside the time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_15">Single Playback Time</h3>
<p>If either <strong>Last note within time priority</strong> or <strong>First note within time priority</strong> has been specified as the control mode, this option is used to specify, in milliseconds, the duration of time to enable control over single playback.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_16">Fix Priority at Release</h3>
<p>If this option is selected, the voice priority of the corresponding sound is not reduced even during release.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_17">3D Vol</h3>
<p>Sets whether 3D sound volume control is applied.<br />Clear this check box to disable 3D sound volume control for sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_18">3D Pan</h3>
<p>Sets whether 3D sound pan control is applied.<br />Clear this check box to disable 3D sound pan control for sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_19">3D SPan</h3>
<p>Sets whether 3D sound surround pan control is applied.<br />Clear this check box to disable 3D sound surround pan control for sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_20">3D Pri</h3>
<p>Sets whether 3D sound player priority control is applied.<br />Clear this check box to disable 3D sound player priority control for sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_21">3D Filter</h3>
<p>Sets whether the 3D sound <code>Biquad</code> filter control is applied.<br />Select this item to enable the 3D sound <code>Biquad</code> filter controls for sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_22">3D Attenuation Curve</h3>
<p>Selects the volume attenuation system to apply to 3D sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_23">3D Attenuation Ratio</h3>
<p>Selects the volume attenuation ratio to apply to 3D sounds.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_24">3D Doppler Factor</h3>
<p>Sets the Doppler effect to perform by the 3D sound.<br />Sets the pitch variation of the Doppler effect as a value in the range from <code>0</code> through <code>255</code>.<br />The default value is <code>0</code>. The larger the value, the greater the change in pitch. A value of <code>0</code> represents absolutely no change in pitch.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_25">Maximum Number of Voiced Sounds</h3>
<p>Displays the maximum number of voiced sounds for a sequence sound.</p>
<p>The display is updated when you measure the maximum number of voiced sounds for a sequence sound.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955638_h3_26">User Parameters</h3>
<p>Configures the 32-bit numerical value that the user is free to set.</p>
<p>To set the composition of the bits, on the <strong>Project</strong> menu, click <strong>Project Settings</strong>. In the <strong>Project Settings</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>User Parameter</strong> tab.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955638_h2_4">Measuring the Maximum Number of Voiced Sounds for a Sequence Sound</h2>
<p>Use this feature to measure the maximum number of voiced sounds for sequence sounds and list the values in this item of the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong>.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Preview</strong> &gt; <strong>Measure Maximum Number of Voiced Sounds for Sequence Sound</strong>.<br />In the dialog box that appears, set a maximum measurement time, and then click <strong>Measure</strong>.</p>

  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955638/124257349.gif" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>The measurement is made starting from the Starting Playback Position of each sound.</p>
<p>Up to 96 voiced sounds can be counted.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955638_h2_5">Create a Text Sequence File</h2>
<p>You can create a converted text sequence file (FSEQ file) from the SMF file.<br />Use these features to create and edit text sequences.</p>
<p>Right-click the <strong>Sequence Sound List</strong> to open the shortcut menu, and then select <strong>Create a Text Sequence File</strong>.</p>
<p> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955638/124257350.gif" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<p>When the dialog box to specify the output folder opens, specify the folder and create a text sequence file.</p>
<p>The output filename is the same as the file selected on the list, but with the extension changed to <code>.fseq</code>.</p>
<p> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955638/124257351.gif" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955638_h2_6">Writing a Template Text Sequence</h2>
<p>The <strong>Starting Playback Position</strong> label does not exist in the text sequence file (FSEQ file), but you can write one to it.</p>
<p> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955638/124257348.gif" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<p>For example, if the <strong>Starting Playback Position</strong> label &quot;abcd&quot; is added and you run <strong>Write Template Text Sequence</strong>, the following text sequence is added to the end of the FSEQ file.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>abcd:<br />fin</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>is added to the end of the FSEQ file.</p>
