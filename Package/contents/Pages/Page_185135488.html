<h1 id="Anchor_185135488_h1_1">Overview</h1>
<p>To build and run a patch, the following steps are required.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Revise the data includes in the application such as programs, resource data, and NMETA files, and create a revised version of the application.</li>
  <li>Specify the initial application, the revised application, and the previous patch if one exists, and then create the patch.</li>
  <li>Write the initial application to a game card, or install it in NAND memory or an SD card.</li>
  <li>Install the patch in NAND memory or an SD card.</li>
  <li>Run from DevMenu or DevMenuCommand.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about these steps, see the following procedures.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135488_h1_2">Creating the Revised Application</h1>
<p>Revise the program and resource data just like you did when you created the initial application, and create a revised version of the NSP file.</p>
<p>Depending on how the resource data is revised, the size of the patch may increase. For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135554.html">Optimization Information</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_185135488_h2_1">Revising NMETA Files</h2>
<p>When creating the revised NSP for the patch, you must edit the NMETA file release version and DisplayVersion. For more information about each setting, see <a href="../Pages/Page_166503043.html">Writing the NMETA File</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_185135488_h3_1">Release Version</h3>
<p>Set a value higher than the value of the initial application. Any value may be set during development, but when you create the final patch, you must specify the value issued from the Nintendo Developer Portal, as described in <a href="../Pages/Page_166503043.html">Writing the NMETA File</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_185135488_h3_2">DisplayVersion</h3>
<p>Set a different value than the value of the initial application. If you set the <strong>DisplayVersion</strong>, the application version shown in DevMenu and DevMenuCommand will change to the revised version. The same version will also be displayed if a patch created with this revised application is installed. We recommend changing this value ahead of time to make it easier to check whether the patch is installed.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Also save the revised application that was used to create the submitted patch as a patch. The revised application is required when revising the program using AuthoringEditor or another tool.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135488_h1_3">Creating the Patch</h1>
<p>Create the patch using the AuthoringTool based on the revised application and initial application. For more information about the required environment for running AuthoringTool, see <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a>.</p>
<p>Patches can also be created by using VSI. For more information about building in VSI, see <a href="../Pages/Page_193046193.html">Creating Patches</a>. Note, however, all that you can perform on VSI is to build the patch. To install the patch and run the patched application, follow the instructions described in this document.</p>
<p>The following section describes how to create a patch using AuthoringTool.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_185135488_h2_4">Capacity and Operating Frequency Settings for NX Cards With On-Card Patches</h2>
<p>For AuthoringToolKit 1.2.0 and later, a size check is performed when the patch is created with the assumption that it will be an on-card patch. A warning message may be displayed when an error occurs.<br />The value set for the generated patch can be referenced by <code>cardspec.xml</code> in the NSP file in the same manner as for the application. For more information, see  <a href="../Pages/Page_177655843.html">NX Development Card</a>. </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_185135488_h3_4">Basic Rules</h3>
<p>In the NSP file of the patch that was generated, specify the NX card capacity and operating frequency set for the revised application as parameters for the NX card with an on-card patch.<br />However, if the capacity value for the revised application is set automatically and it is smaller than the NX card with an on-card patch, the capacity required for the NX card with an on-card patch will be set automatically in the patch NSP.</p>
<p>The method for specifying the NX card capacity and operating frequency manually for the application is described in the <code>CardSpec</code> of the NMETA file. For more information, see  <a href="../Pages/Page_177655843.html">NX Development Card</a>. </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_185135488_h3_5">Cases Where Warnings Appear</h3>
<p>In each of these cases, the warning may be ignored if there are no plans to produce NX cards with on-card patches.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The operating frequency set for the initial application differs from the operating frequency that is <strong>set automatically</strong> for the revised application.<ul><li>&quot;Warning: Card clock rates differ between original nsp and current nsp.&quot; is displayed.</li><li><p>To avoid the warning, manually set the operating frequency for the revised application.</p><div class="tip"><div class="tip_left">Info</div><div class="tip_right"><p>If the NX card operating frequency was different for the initial application and revised application, this may affect the behavior of the application in the NX card with an on-card patch.<br />When considering production of NX cards with on-card patches using patches with these types of settings, submit the patch after thoroughly verifying the NX development card with an on-card patch.  </p></div></div></li></ul></li>
  <li>The size set for the initial application differs from the capacity that is <strong>set automatically</strong> for the revised application.<ul><li>&quot;Warning: Card sizes differ between original nsp and current nsp.&quot; is displayed.</li><li>To avoid the warning, manually set the capacity for the revised application.</li></ul></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_185135488_h3_6">Cases Where Errors Appear</h3>
<p>In each case, appropriate handling is required such as revising the value or optimizing the patch size if there are plans to produce NX cards with on-card patches.<br />If there are no plans to produce NX cards with on-card patches, avoid the error by setting the revised application operating frequency automatically.</p>

<p>To use the patch, you must install it in NAND memory or an SD card, or write it to an NX development card as an on-card patch.</p>
<p>Many users use applications installed to the NAND or SD card, so basically perform debugging using this format. Operation verification is required for on-card patches if there are plans to re-produce NX cards that already have the patch applied.</p>
<p>Also, the latest NSP patch file always contains all of the required differential information, so none of the earlier patches are required when preparing a new patch. You do not need to install earlier patches on the system either.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>If you install and check the patch using the previously-described procedure, that is sufficient for the debug environment and there is no need to download and test the patch. In any event, there are no plans to provide an environment for downloading and testing patches.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_185135488_h2_5">Installation</h2>
<p>You can install the patch and check it using the <code>patch</code> command of DevMenuCommand.</p>
<table class="codeblock">

<p>The patch is installed to the system NAND by default. Specify <code>sdcard</code> using the <code>-s</code> option when installing the patch to an SD card. For more information about the <code>-s</code> option, see <a href="../Pages/Page_424117421.html">DevMenuCommand</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_185135488_h2_6">On-Card Patches</h2>
<p>To create NX development cards with on-card patches, use the <code>gamecard</code> command in DevMenuCommand. Prepare the initial application and target patch, and write the patch by executing the following command.</p>
<table class="codeblock">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <div class="codeblock"><pre>$ RunOnTarget.exe $NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT/TargetTools/NX-NXFP2-a64/DevMenuCommand/Release/DevMenuCommand.nsp -- gamecard write absolute_app_path/app.nsp --on-card-patch absolute_patch_path/patch-v1.nsp</pre></div>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h1 id="Anchor_185135488_h1_6">Running the Patched Application</h1>
<p>After you prepare the initial application and the patch, you can run the application in the patched state by starting the application from DevMenu or DevMenuCommand, just like you would for an application on a card or installed in the system.</p>
<p>The same is true for on-card patches. Starting the application from the card starts it in the state with the patch already applied.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_107779320.html">Installing Applications on Development Hardware</a> and <a href="../Pages/Page_166051528.html">Writing to NX Development Cards</a>.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>After starting the application in the patched state, make sure to restart the target before using VSI or RunOnTarget to run the host application again. Otherwise, the patch will only be partially applied to the host application.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_185135488_h1_7">Removing Patches<a name="Anchor_185135488_patch_deletion"></a></h1>
<p>To remove a patch, use the <code>patch uninstall</code> command of DevMenuCommand.</p>
<p>You can also remove the patch using the <code>application uninstall</code> command, but it will also remove the initial application if it is installed. To remove just the patch, use the <code>patch uninstall</code> command.</p>
<p>However, if the preceding command is used to just delete the patch, the unpatched application cannot be started due to the required version system. The required version must also be reset to enable starting the unpatched application. Use <code>application reset-required-version</code> in DevMenuCommand to reset it.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>In HomeMenu, a message is displayed when the application gets caught on the required version check and cannot start, saying that the software must be updated and the patch will be downloaded. In the development environment, you cannot download a patch even if you press the download button, so either reset the required version or install the patch.</p>
