<h1 id="Anchor_272359830_h1_1">Overview</h1>
<p>As its name implies, the Low-Level Graphics Debugger is a dedicated low-level graphics debugger for NVN. Like the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a>, the Low-Level Graphics Debugger allows you to examine resources and the state of the graphics pipeline&mdash;at a lower level&mdash;in order to debug your application.</p>
<p>Low-Level Graphics Debugger is intended to be used for debugging applications. ROMs that use this library cannot be uploaded to the Nintendo Developer Portal (NDP) as master ROMs.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_272359830_h2_1">Packages</h2>
<p>The Low-Level Graphics Debugger is provided as a separate package from the NintendoSDK NX Add-On. It may also be released later than other NintendoSDK packages.</p>
<p>The following table lists the packages.</p>
<table class="wrapped">
  <colgroup>
    <col />

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Package Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Low-Level Graphics Debugger</td>
      <td>A dedicated low-level graphics debugger for NVN.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="Anchor_272359830_h2_2">Location</h2>
<p>The Low-Level Graphics Debugger can be found at the following path directly under the NintendoSDK installation directory.</p>
<table class="codeblock">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <div class="codeblock"><pre>NintendoSDK/

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition, a library file named <code>llgd-target.nso</code>, for the Low-Level Graphics Debugger, is located in the <code>Libraries</code> directory of the NintendoSDK. To use the Low-Level Graphics Debugger, you need to link <code>llgd-target.nso</code> as an additional NSO file to the target application.<br />A header file named <code>llgd.h</code> for the Low-Level Graphics Debugger is located in the <code>Include</code> directory of the NintendoSDK. Include this <code>llgd.h</code> header file to use the API of the Low-Level Graphics Debugger.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_272359830_h1_3">Differences From the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a></h1>
<p>The Low-Level Graphics Debugger provides many of the same features as the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a>; the two programs are also intended to be used in similar ways to achieve similar goals. This section provides a brief overview of the differences between the two tools to help you decide which is best suited to your needs. For more information about the different feature sets, see their respective documentation.</p>
<p>The <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a> captures NVN API calls, but the Low-Level Graphics Debugger captures commands sent to the GPU. Consequently, this tool captures the actual state of the hardware and tends to make it impossible to perfectly reproduce the arguments that your application passes to the NVN API. It also tends to result in fewer available features than the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a>.</p>
<p>The Low-Level Graphics Debugger can only be used with applications running on NX development hardware. Unlike the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a>, it cannot capture data from applications running on a PC.</p>
<p>The Low-Level Graphics Debugger is designed to be lightweight. It uses less than 10 MB of memory while it is capturing data, and it has practically no CPU overhead while it is idle. On the other hand, it cannot analyze data in real time like the <a href="../Pages/Page_100905829.html">NVN Graphics Debugger</a>. A data capture can also be triggered using the LLGD API from the target application instead of via the tool&rsquo;s UI.</p>
