<!-- Analyze your Profile -->

<div class="text_separate">
<p>We recommend the following workflow after taking a profile. However, once you get comfortable and better understand the profiler, you can more easily pursue clues and deeply inspect interesting areas on your own, deviating from the guide below. Ultimately, understanding your game will be an exploratory process and there are many ways to do this.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_693933913_h1_1">1. Check that your Profile Data is Accurate</h1>
<p>Before looking at the profile data, please answer these two questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Did you profile a Debug build?</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>If yes, this is a problem because the profile data will be inaccurate and misleading.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Profiling a Debug build is not helpful since the code is not optimized. If your purpose in profiling is to find optimization opportunities, a Debug build will be misleading. Do not waste your time profiling a Debug build.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Profile a Release build.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Note:</strong> If you are a Unity developer and only have an EDEV kit, then you will not be able to profile a Release build. While the profile data is misleading, you might still be able to get some value by looking at the data. In particular, there are specific <strong>Checkers</strong> for Unity builds that you should pay attention to if they were triggered (look at the <strong>Checkers</strong> tab).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are any Critical Checkers listed in the Checkers tab? (they have a black <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288523/813981832.png" width="26" class="embedded-image" /></span>&nbsp;arrow next to them)</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>If yes, then there are known issues causing inaccurate results. The image below shows one black Critical Checker that needs to be fixed.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Critical Checkers are issues that cause inaccurate or misleading profile data. Do not waste time looking at the profile if any Critical Checkers were triggered.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Fix all Critical Checker issues and then profile again.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

  </span>
</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_693933913_h1_2">2. Look at the Top Functions</h1>
<p>In the left <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198897.html">Functions</a> </strong> tab, you will see a list of the top functions by time.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_761284427/813981817.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>By default, the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198897.html">Functions</a> </strong>tab is sorted by&nbsp;<strong>Self</strong>, which is the time spent inside the function itself (but not functions it called). If you want to sort based on the time spent in the function and its children, then click on the header&nbsp;<strong>Total</strong>. The figure below visually shows the difference between <strong>Total</strong> time and <strong>Self</strong> time for a &quot;Function&quot; that calls two child functions.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_804026171/813981888.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>In the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198897.html">Functions</a> </strong>tab, start at the top of the list and move downward looking for suspicious functions that should not be taking very long. Examples of functions that shouldn't take much time are memory, string, or math functions. To better understand a suspicious function, select it with a left click. Once selected, you can see where it's called in the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198978.html">Call Tree</a> </strong> tab or you can view the raw data within each frame in the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_764970037.html">Timeline</a> </strong> tab.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_693933913_h1_3">3. Explore the Call Tree</h1>
<p>By exploring the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198978.html">Call Tree</a></strong>, you can follow the hot path to identify areas to focus on. Start at the root of the tree and expand the highest percentages. To do this quickly, you can right click on a function and select <strong>Hot Path from Here</strong>.</p>
<p>
  <br />

  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288523/813981830.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_693933913_h1_4">4. Visually Inspect your Frames in the Timeline Tab</h1>
<p>In the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_764970037.html">Timeline</a> </strong>you can explore the raw data of the profile. Sometimes its easy to miss clues when you look at averages in the <strong>Functions</strong> or <strong>Call Tree</strong> tabs. There is real value to looking at the raw data to understand the outliers, the spikes, and the details in the data.</p>
<p>To start, select one interesting function in the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198897.html">Functions</a> </strong>tab and then look at the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_764970037.html">Timeline</a> </strong>tab. By default, the <strong>System Load</strong> graph is shown (seen in the image below), which represents the load of various systems over the duration of the profile. The alternating gray/white vertical stripes show the individual frames. Looking at this&nbsp;<strong>System Load</strong> graph, you can see that most of the time is spent in <strong>Idle</strong> (shown in red) with <strong>Graphics</strong> (shown in purple) greatly varying frame-by-frame. The color key at the top explains the color coding (please see the <strong> <a href="../Pages/Page_758198729.html">System Classifications</a> </strong> section for an explanation of this automatic classification).</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288523/813981844.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>The function you initially selected will be shown as a single row with many short vertical lines that represent every sample recorded.</p>
<p>To explore this further, deselect the <strong>System Load</strong> graph in the toolbar and instead select the <strong>Icicle Graph</strong>. The <strong>Icicle Graph</strong> is best viewed if you zoom into an individual frame. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in until it looks like the image below.</p>
