<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_1">Confirmation of Compliance with the Nintendo Switch Guidelines</h1>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Guidelines, provided separately, define items that applications should comply with. Check that all applications are in compliance with the guidelines. If an application does not comply with all applicable items in the guidelines, the Master ROM will not be accepted.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_2">Verify That No Development Performance Configurations Are Used</h1>
<p>Among the performance configurations in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__oe__PerformanceConfiguration">nn::oe::PerformanceConfiguration</span></code> that can be set, there are several configurations that can only be used for development purposes. Applications that use any of the development-only performance configurations will not run on retail NX systems, and as a result, you must verify that your application is not using any of these performance configurations. We recommend running your application on an EDEV that is set to PROD MODE and then verifying that the application continues to work correctly in scenes in which the performance configuration set for <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__oe__SetPerformanceConfiguration">nn::oe::SetPerformanceConfiguration</span></code> is updated.</p>
<p>See the following page for more information about the performance configurations available in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__oe__PerformanceConfiguration">nn::oe::PerformanceConfiguration</span></code>.</p>
<ul>

  </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_3">Verify That All Check Items Are Configured Correctly During Application Startup</h1>
<p>If executing the application through VSI or RunOnTarget, several checks will be run during application startup such as for account selection, creating save data, and Parental Controls restrictions. However, not all checks or processing will be performed. Starting the application from VSI and RunOnTarget are features for development purposes, and there are differences from the retail version.</p>
<p>To check whether the various metadata for the application have been correctly configured, start the application by selecting its icon in the HOME Menu. It does not matter whether the application is installed on the system or written to an NX development card.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_166503043.html">Writing the NMETA File</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_4">Enabling the File System Speed Emulation Feature</h1>
<p>The access speeds at which an application can access storage media vary according to both the type of storage media used and deterioration in performance over time. For this reason, developers must ensure that applications are implemented in a way that does not depend on storage media access speed so that users can progress in the application regardless of the current access speed. To test this capability, you must enable the speed emulation feature while testing an application. This testing procedure is also required during development of packaged versions of applications.</p>
<p>After installing the application to the system&rsquo;s NAND memory, test the application in all of the following speed emulation modes: Slower Mode, Faster Mode, and Random Mode. The speed emulation feature can be enabled from DevMenu in <strong>Debug</strong> &gt; <strong>FS Speed Emulation Mode</strong>. For more information about testing applications and using the speed emulation feature, see the following page.</p>

    <p align="left">The Slower Mode in the file system speed emulation feature can be used in combination with the background download stress test.</p>
    <p align="left">However, do not use Faster Mode or Random Mode in combination with the background download stress test. The background download stress test causes a decrease in file system access speed, which prevents the fast access speed and randomly-varying access speed modes from emulating the intended performance configurations.</p>
    <p align="left">In addition, the Slower Mode setting is only intended to test for serious bugs, such as when the application crashes or stops responding. Do not use it to optimize application performance for slower SD cards.</p>

    <p>This test item can be tested from the development phase. You can enable these settings in both DEV MODE and PROD MODE. However, do not enable them in the PROD MODE environment used for final application testing.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_5">Testing Support for Combinations of Operation Modes and Performance Modes</h1>
<p>
  <br />Confirm that the application supports all combinations of operation modes and performance modes. (Excludes applications that do not support certain play styles.)<br />The combinations of operation modes and performance modes are shown in the following table.</p>
<table class="wrapped" style="margin-left: 1.5em;">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 115.0px;" />
    <col style="width: 328.0px;" />
    <col style="width: 482.0px;" />
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center;">
        <br /> </th>
      <th style="text-align: center;">
        <p>Handheld Mode</p>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align: center;">
        <p>Console Mode</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center;">Normal mode</th>
      <td>The combination when the system is not docked.</td>
      <td>The combination when the system is docked and <strong>there is insufficient remaining battery life.</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center;">Boost mode</th>
      <td class="highlight-grey">Does not occur</td>
      <td>The combination when the system is docked and there is sufficient remaining battery life.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In most cases, the combination is &quot;handheld mode and normal mode&quot; or &quot;tabletop mode and boost mode,&quot; but <strong>&quot;tabletop mode and normal mode&quot;</strong> is also a possibility.<br />To play the application in the expected way in all combinations, you must properly implement a process that supports all of the transitions, without confusing the operation mode transitions and the performance mode transitions.</p>
<p>It is difficult to sustain the combination of &quot;tabletop mode and normal mode&quot; with normal operations. To debug this combination, use the DevMenuCommand tool's features for setting the operation mode control policy, and the performance mode control policy, as described in <a href="../Pages/Page_325711330.html">Development Support Features</a>.</p>
<p>In NX Add-On 3.2.0 and later, these settings are now easier to configure because features to set the operation mode control policy and the performance mode control policy have been added to the DevMenu page to assist development (debugging). For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_310879077.html">Controlling the Development Hardware &gt; DevMenuCommand</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the operation modes and the performance modes, see the following pages.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_6">Testing the Video Capture Feature Activated by Long-Pressing the Capture Button</h1>
<p>Starting in NX Add-On 4.2.0 (or in 3.6.0 or later for NX Add-On 3.x), the Switch system features include a video capture feature activated by long-pressing the Capture Button.</p>
<p>This feature is enabled by default in applications, but it can be completely disabled using the setting in the NMETA file, and it can be temporarily disabled by using a function call.</p>
<p>When the application is in focus, a long press of the <strong>Capture Button</strong> activates the process of video capture.<br />Check that you can disable and re-enable this feature, and that the increased processing load, due to video capture, does not impair your application.</p>
<p>For more information about the processing load of the video capture feature, see the following page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="../Pages/Page_172895510.html">Important Implementation Information (NX Add-On)</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the NMETA file settings and the function for video capture, see the following pages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="../Pages/Page_166503043.html">Writing the NMETA File</a>

<h1 id="Anchor_277358730_h1_7">
  <span style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">Testing With the System Tick Default Value Changed</span>
  <br />
</h1>
<p>Even though calling <code>tick.GetInt64Value()</code> on the tick value that was obtained returns an <code>int64_t</code> type immediate system tick value, do not convert this value to a <code>float</code>, <code>int32_t</code> or another small or low-precision type value for the purposes of equality or size comparisons.<br />System ticks continue to advance, even during sleep mode, without the Switch frequently restarting. As a result, the system tick values can become very large.</p>
<p>When you convert the values to types that are smaller than <code>int64_t</code> and lower in precision, information in the original system tick values can get lost and comparison operations can be incorrect.<br />As a result, the application cannot start, or excessive processing slowdowns or stalls may occur.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, check the behavior using the following procedure for applications that use the <span class="ApiLink_nn__os__Tick">nn::os::Tick class</span>.<br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Set the values for <strong>Initial Tick Value</strong> in <a href="../Pages/Page_310879077.html">Development Assistance Settings</a>.</li>
  <li>Restart the system.</li>
  <li>Start the application and check the behavior.</li>
  <li>Step 1. Set all values except for <strong>Custom</strong> in <strong>Initial Tick Value</strong>, and perform steps 1 to 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>The test procedure uses setting values except for <strong>Custom</strong> for the sake of convenience, but it is not a problem to check behavior using the <strong>Custom</strong> setting as necessary.<br />Because occurrence of this problem is dependent on the application's implementation, test the <strong>Initial Tick Value</strong> using small values through large values.</p>
