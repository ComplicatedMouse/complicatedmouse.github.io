<h1 id="Anchor_83955836_h1_1">Files Used in the Library</h1>
<p>This section describes the files that are implemented in the application but placed in storage and used via the <code>atk</code> library .</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955836_h2_1">Sound Archive File</h2>
<p>This file is the body of sound data used by the atk library. The file has the <code>.bfsar</code> extension and is created by SoundMaker.</p>
<p>It contains the various sounds for stream sounds, wave sounds, and sequence sounds, together with information about players, groups, and waveform archives. It also contains sequence data and waveform data for banks and wave sounds, but only the waveform data for stream sounds is referenced as external files (called <em>stream files</em>, and described in the following section).</p>
<p>Sound archive files can be located anywhere in storage.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955836_h3_1">Items</h3>
<p>The elements of a sound archive file are called <em>items</em>. Stream sounds, wave sounds, sequence sounds, banks, waveform archives, players, and groups are all items in the sound archive file.</p>
<p>All items are managed using the strings by which they are named. As many as around 4.3 billion separate items (2^32) can be used in a single sound archive file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955836_h3_2">Reference File Path</h3>
<p>The sound archive file references stream files to play stream sounds, and these files are external files.</p>
<p>The paths to these stream files are stored using relative paths to the directory holding the sound archive file.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955836_h2_2">Stream File</h2>
<p>These files store the waveform data for the stream sounds used by the sound archive file. A stream file has the <code>.bfstm</code> extension and is created by SoundMaker.</p>
<p>Stream files must be located somewhere that can be referenced from the file path for the sound archive file.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955836_h3_3">Output From SoundMaker and Placement in Storage</h3>
<p>When stream files are created with SoundMaker, they are usually output to the <code>output</code> folder, located at the same level of the hierarchy as the sound project file being converted. You can use the Project Settings of SoundMaker to specify any directory below the <code>output</code> folder.</p>
<p>The location of stream files below the <code>output</code> folder as specified in the Project Settings is stored as the stream file reference file path in the sound archive file.</p>
<p>Everything below the <code>output</code> folder can be stored anywhere in storage and used.</p>
