<p>Guidelines specify that applications must operate correctly, even if the access speed to the storage media changes.<br />The FS speed emulation feature allows you to debug applications using three patterns of access speed.</p>

    <p>Use development hardware initialized with NintendoSDK Firmware for NX 5.0.0-4 (NX Add-On 5.3.0) or later.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not remove the SD card from the development hardware.</li>
  <li>Install the application, add-on content, or patch that you want to test behavior for, to the system memory.<ol><li>For more information about installing applications, see <a href="../Pages/Page_107779320.html">Installing Applications on Development Hardware</a>.</li><li>For more information about installing downloadable content, see <a href="../Pages/Page_163289579.html">Managing Downloadable Content</a>.</li><li>For more information about installing patches, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185135488.html">Building and Running a Patch</a>.</li></ol></li>
  <li>From <a href="../Pages/Page_107328771.html">DevMenu</a>, select the <strong>Debug</strong> menu tab to configure the FS Speed Emulation Mode.<br />Effective from NX Add-On 1.1.0, you can also use DevMenuCommand to configure the setting. For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_325711330.html">DevMenuCommand &gt; Development Support Features</a>.</li>
  <li>Play through the application and check the behavior.</li>

<p>The FS Speed Emulation Mode settings return to the initial state when the development hardware is restarted or reset.</p>

    <p>If not enough memory is available when installing all of the application, patches, and downloadable content to the development hardware system memory, use an SD card that supports UHS-I (Ultra High Speed Phase I, loading speed 60 to 95 MB per second).<br />The speed emulation feature is implemented by delaying access to the storage media, so more optimal testing can be performed by using storage media with a faster access speed. Make sure to place the test subject in system memory, and also place the other data in system memory as much as possible. Also use an SD card that is as fast as possible.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_177646410_h1_3">Speed Emulation Feature</h1>
<p>The speed emulation feature slows down system memory access speed, with the fastest access speed in the storage media, to emulate storage media with slow access speed.<br />The speed emulation feature has the following modes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster mode<br />Operates with no delay in access to system memory and with a simplified version of the security processing of the retail product.<br />Represents operations on development hardware where access speeds are as fast as they can be. Covers a wider range of testing conditions for faster environments, including when hardware is faster because of individual console differences or because of system improvements.<br />Effective from NintendoSDK SystemUpdater for NX 2.0.0-3 (NX Add-On 1.0.0), Faster mode simplifies the security processing of the retail product. As a result, it operates faster than OFF, which operates in a manner that closely resembles the retail product.<br />In versions earlier than NintendoSDK SystemUpdater for NX 2.0.0-3 (NX Add-On 1.0.0), Faster mode and OFF had the same behavior because there was no support for the security processing of installed applications in the retail device.</li>
  <li>Slower mode<br />Introduces a certain delay, corresponding to the method used for accessing system memory.<br />Emulates a storage media with unvarying slow access speed, comparable to the types of slower external storage devices that can be encountered in the commercial market.<br />In versions earlier than NintendoSDK SystemUpdater for NX 5.0.0-1 (NX Add-On 5.1.0), access to data stored only in system memory, was restricted to a slower speed equivalent to a slow-operating external storage device. </li>
  <li>Random mode<br />Creates a random delay corresponding to the access method for system memory access.<br />This emulates responsiveness fluctuations of storage media internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>For actual measurements of performance in <strong>Faster</strong> mode and <strong>Slower</strong> mode, see <a href="../Pages/Page_185130689.html">Performance</a>.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>Slower</strong> mode in combination with <a href="../Pages/Page_325711330.html#Anchor_325711330_h1_24">background download stress testing</a>.<br />However, do not use <strong>Faster</strong> mode or <strong>Random</strong> mode in combination with this test. This is because access is slowed by the download stress test, so you cannot conduct the testing as intended using steadily fast or randomly changing access speeds.</p>
<p>In NintendoSDK Firmware for NX 5.0.0-1 (NX Add-On 5.1.0) and later, accessing the SD supports slowing down access depending on the mode. However, the speed emulation feature is implemented by slowing down access to storage media, so more appropriate emulation can be performed by placing the data in system memory with a fast access speed rather than on the SD card.<br /></p>
<p>Note that the speed emulation feature does not assure the maximum and minimum speeds of the NX in the future. In the future, smaller storage media and system improvements may cause the access speed from the application to be faster than during verification. Users may also use retail external storage media that is a slower speed.</p>
