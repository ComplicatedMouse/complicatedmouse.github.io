<!-- Overview Tab -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_758198966">Overview Tab</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The&nbsp;<strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Overview</strong> tab displays a summary of the profile results at a glance.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198966_h1_1">Warnings</h1>
<p>When a <strong>Warning</strong> is logged, the&nbsp;<strong>Warnings Banner</strong> appears at the top of the <strong>Overview</strong> tab. The banner can be opened by clicking it once, and closed by clicking it again. Clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>Click here to view warnings in more detail</strong>&nbsp;link will open the <strong>Warnings Window</strong> where warnings show their complete text and the text can be copied.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198966_h1_2">Left Pane</h1>
<p>The left pane of the <strong>Overview</strong> tab contains elements that display a visual representation of the profile results.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198966_h2_1">Hot Functions by Self</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Hot Functions by Self</strong> section displays functions which took the most time, not including the functions they call. This element supports the following interactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hovering over a function will display its full name in a tooltip.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Expanding the width of the window will reveal more of each function's name.</li>
  <li>Clicking on a function will select it in the <strong>Functions</strong>&nbsp;tab. All instances of the function will be selected in the functions list.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>The percentages shown for each function are added up across all threads and cores the function was found on. As such, it is possible for a function to have a percentage over 100%.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198966_h2_2">Work Breakdown</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Work Breakdown</strong> section displays the systems that took the most CPU time. Clicking on one of the systems will select all functions belonging to that system in the <strong>Functions</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>
<p>The percentages shown are found by adding up the self time for every function in each classification group. More details about the function classification system can be found at&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_758198729.html">System Classifications</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198966_h2_3">Checkers</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Checkers</strong> section contains elements that show the state of various checkers.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_758198966_h3_1">Checkers Icons</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Checkers Icons</strong> display the checker severity levels, marked with how many checkers of each severity were triggered. Clicking on an icon will open the <strong>Checkers</strong>&nbsp;tab and scroll so that a checker of that severity will be visible.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_758198966_h3_2">High-Severity Checkers</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>High-Severity Checkers</strong>&nbsp;section shows the names of all high-severity checkers that triggered. Click on a high-severity checker to open the <strong>Checkers</strong>&nbsp;tab and expand the checker that was selected.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198966_h1_3">Right Pane</h1>
<p>The right pane of the <strong>Overview</strong> tab contains extra information about the profile.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198966_h2_4">Screenshot Preview</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 1.0em;">The&nbsp;<strong>Screenshot Preview</strong>&nbsp;displays a screenshot that was taken at the end of a profile. If no screenshot data is included in the profile, the preview will instead show a solid gray rectangle with a white X indicating that there is no screenshot.</p>
<p>Clicking the red <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">X</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the&nbsp;<strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Screenshot Preview</strong>&nbsp;removes the screenshot from the profile. If the profile was loaded from disk, it will need to be resaved to permanently remove the screenshot from the saved profile.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.0em;">Clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Screenshot Preview</strong>&nbsp;itself will open a larger screenshot viewer window. In this window, use the mouse to pan and zoom.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.0em;">
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198966_h2_5">Profile Info</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Profile Info</strong> section contains a short list of information about the profile. The <strong>View Detailed Info</strong> link at the bottom of the list opens a window with a more complete set of information and statistics for the profile. See the&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_758199045.html">Info Window</a>&nbsp;section for more detail. If there is no data for one of the below items, it will not be displayed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Profile Duration:&nbsp;</strong>The duration of the profile according to an arbitrary core. It is possible for there to be a slight variance between durations on each core.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Total Samples:&nbsp;</strong>The total number of samples seen across all cores.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Average Framerate:&nbsp;</strong>The average frame rate seen while profiling. This relies on the user-logged main heartbeat.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Threads Seen:&nbsp;</strong>The total number of unique threads seen executing across all cores.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Max Callstack Depth:&nbsp;</strong>The depth of the deepest callstack found at any time while profiling across all cores (only visible if a callstack profile was taken).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Functions Seen:&nbsp;</strong>The number of unique functions seen executing across all cores.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Functions Not Seen:&nbsp;</strong>The number of unique functions which were present in the executable but not seen executing at any point during the profile.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Build SDK:</strong> The SDK that was used to build the application that was profiled.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Buffer Used:&nbsp;</strong>The size of the raw data buffer.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Game:&nbsp;</strong>The name of the executable file on the hard drive.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Computer:&nbsp;</strong>The name of the computer that ran the profiler.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Captured By:&nbsp;</strong>The name of the user logged into the computer that ran the profiler.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Captured On:&nbsp;</strong>The time and date at which the profile was taken.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198966_h2_6">Profiler Overhead</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Profiler Overhead&nbsp;</strong>element shows the average overhead for the entire profile across all cores. For a detailed breakdown of the overhead per core, click the <strong>View Detailed Info</strong> link in the Profile Info section.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sample Rate</strong>&nbsp;is located immediately under the&nbsp;<strong>Profiler Overhead</strong> element. It displays the requested sample rate at the time the profile was taken.</p>
