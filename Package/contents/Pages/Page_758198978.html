<!-- Call Tree Tab -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_758198978">Call Tree Tab</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Call Tree</strong> tab shows the discovered call tree based on the profiled sample data. This tab only appears if the&nbsp;profile was taken with <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Callstack</strong> data enabled.</p>
<p>To change the units displayed before each item, use the <strong>Unit</strong> buttons in the <strong>Home</strong> tab of the <strong>Ribbon Bar</strong>.</p>
<p>Each function that is not a root item in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>Partial Call Tree</strong> will show an impact bar as the left-most item. This impact bar shows how much impact that function had based on the current selection of the <strong>Bar graph data source</strong> drop down.</p>
<div class="note_new">

  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>These notes point out differences in the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab when the <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> experimental feature is enabled. See&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Experimental Features Tab</a> for additional information.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_758198978_h1_1">Function Grouping</h1>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This feature is only available when <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> are enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The call trees in this tab are grouped according to the the viewing mode. See <a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Experimental Features Tab</a>&nbsp;for a description of function grouping.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198978_h1_2">Call Tree Tab Toolbar</h1>
<p>The following controls are on the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab toolbar.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_1">Function Grouping Mode Drop Down</h2>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This feature is only available when <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> are enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>This drop down list controls the function grouping mode. Note that it will also control the function grouping mode of the&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_758198897.html">Functions Tab</a>. A description of each mode can be found on the page&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Experimental Features Tab</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_2">Prefix Selection</h2>
<p>The prefix before each function name is determined by the three <strong>Prefix</strong> toggle buttons in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>&nbsp;toolbar. By default, the <strong>Total</strong> and <strong>Self</strong> prefixes are turned on. To toggle a prefix on and off, click on the particular prefix button. If all buttons are set to off, just the function name will be shown. The prefix choices are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Total:</strong> Time spent in each function and the functions it calls.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self:</strong> Time spent in each function, not including the functions it calls.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sub:</strong> Time spent in functions that are called by this function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the functions at each level of the tree are sorted based on the prefix. If <strong>Total</strong>, <strong>Self</strong>, or <strong>Sub</strong> are&nbsp;selected, the sorting is from highest to lowest of the leftmost prefix. If no prefix is selected, the sorting is&nbsp;alphabetical, based on the function name.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_3">Expand All Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Expand All</strong> button expands all possible items in the view.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_4">Collapse All Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Collapse All</strong> button collapses all possible items in the view.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_5">Auto Expand Drop Down</h2>
<p>By default, the <strong>Call Tree</strong> will auto-expand and auto-collapse based on&nbsp;which functions are selected in either the <strong>Functions</strong> tab or the&nbsp;<strong>Call Tree</strong> tab, as well as the&nbsp;<strong>Find</strong> text box at the bottom of the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab.</p>
<p>The <strong>Auto Expand</strong> drop down box has three options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto Expand Off:</strong> The <strong>Call Tree</strong> will not expand or collapse when functions are selected, deselected, or highlighted by <strong>Find</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto Expand Only:</strong> The <strong>Call Tree</strong> will expand (but not collapse) when functions are selected or&nbsp;highlighted by <strong>Find</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto Expand/Collapse:</strong> The <strong>Call Tree</strong> will expand and collapse when functions are selected/deselected or highlighted by <strong>Find</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also quickly expand and collapse the entire tree with the <strong>Expand All</strong> and <strong>Collapse All</strong>&nbsp;buttons.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_6">Copy Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Copy</strong> button will copy to the clipboard all selected or found items in their current expanded or collapsed state. If there are no selected or found items, only the root nodes of the tree will be copied.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_7">Copy All Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Copy All</strong> button will copy to the clipboard all items in their current expanded or collapsed state. All items are copied regardless of what is currently selected or found.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_8">Bar graph data source</h2>
<p>Changing the<strong> Bar graph data source</strong> option changes how the profiler displays the bars that appear to the left of functions in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>.</p>
<p>The drop down has two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Total impact</strong>: The impact bar height gradually decreases the farther down the tree you get. The height is based on this function's <strong>Total</strong> value compared against the root node's <strong>Total</strong>&nbsp;value.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Local impact</strong>: The impact bar height shows relative busyness within a function. The height is based on this function's <strong>Total</strong> value compared against its parent's <strong>Total</strong> value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The values in this drop down are applied to both the full <strong>Call Tree</strong> and the <strong>Partial Call Tree</strong> views.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198978_h1_3">Find Feature</h1>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> text box at the bottom of the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab will auto-expand and highlight all matching functions (regardless of the <strong>Auto Expand</strong> drop down option selection). This behaves similar to the <strong>Filter</strong> text box in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198978_h1_4">Function Selection</h1>
<p>Clicking on a function in the <strong>Call Tree</strong> will highlight the function, similarly to how function selection works in&nbsp;the <strong>Functions</strong> tab. All instances of the highlighted function will be&nbsp;highlighted in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>. If auto-expanding is on (<strong>Auto Expand/Collapse</strong> or <strong>Auto Expand Only</strong>), then the tree will be expanded to show all instances of&nbsp;the selected function.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198978_h1_5">Right-Click Context Menu</h1>
<p>A right-click in the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab will bring up a context menu containing the following options:</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hot Path From Here</strong>
</p>
<p>Recursively expands all nodes from this point that meet the criteria for being on a hot code path.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Expand from Here</strong>
</p>
<p>Recursively expand all nodes from this point.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collapse to Here</strong>
</p>
<p>Recursively collapse all nodes to this point.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Copy Function Name to Clipboard</strong>
</p>
<p>Copy the function name to the clipboard.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Show Assembly</strong>
</p>
<p>Move focus to the <strong>Assembly Tab</strong>, showing the assembly of the clicked&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Show Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Open a new <strong>Function Details</strong>&nbsp;window, showing the details of the clicked&nbsp;function.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198978_h1_6">Partial Call Tree</h1>
<p>When a function is selected, it will also appear in the <strong>Partial Call Tree</strong> at the bottom of the <strong>Call Tree</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>
<p>There are three different views available in this sub-window: <strong>Forward from Selected</strong>, <strong>Reverse from Selected</strong>, and <strong>Legacy Reverse</strong>.</p>
<p>In each of the three views, the&nbsp;<strong>Total</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Self</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Sub</strong>&nbsp;values are calculated as the percentage of the profile where the&nbsp;specific tree view was present.</p>
<p>The <strong>Partial Call Tree</strong> window can be resized by dragging the header up and down. It can also be&nbsp;collapsed by clicking on the down arrow on the right side of the header and similarly expanded by clicking&nbsp;on the up arrow.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_9">Forward from Selected</h2>
<p>This view treats all selected functions as the root. Expanding each root allows you to travel down&nbsp;the call tree, producing a view similar to that of the Call Tree. The difference, though, is that if there are&nbsp;multiple identical functions in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>, this view will combine the selected function into a single entry (adding up all of their times, similar to the <strong>Functions</strong> tab).&nbsp;This allows for easier viewing of the calls made by the selected function.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_10">Reverse from Selected</h2>
<p>This view treats all selected functions as the root. Expanding each root&nbsp;allows you to travel up&nbsp;the call tree. However, this is not just a simple reversal of the call tree, but instead separates and groups&nbsp;functions based on how they are called in order to show relationships that would otherwise be hard to see.&nbsp;For example, a vector normalize function might appear 10 times in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>, but it might be called&nbsp;from only 3 different functions. In this case, the vector normalize function will be listed once, with three child&nbsp;nodes (one for each calling function).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198978_h2_11">Legacy Reverse</h2>
<p>This view is similar to <strong>Reverse from Selected</strong>. The difference is that there will be a unique root for each time the selected function appeared in the Call Tree, with the list ordered by time spent. This is the legacy behavior from&nbsp;previous versions of the profiler and can be useful in certain situations.</p>
