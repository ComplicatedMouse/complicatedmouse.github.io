<h1 id="Anchor_195591589_h1_1">Behavior Policies for Network Connections</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_195591589_h2_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>This section describes the behavior policies for network connections on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Aside from submitting network use requests, applications cannot otherwise affect the behavior of the device with regard to network connections. For this reason, applications must not incorporate specific expectations for the network connection status when a network use request has not been submitted, or for the network selections and other implicit operations performed when a use request is submitted. The descriptions in this section are intended to allow users to understand the system behavior so that they can create appropriate verification patterns for application verification.</p>
<p>The policies for selecting network connections may change due to system updates.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_195591589_h2_2">Basic Policy</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_195591589_h3_1">Autonomous Connection</h3>
<p>The system always attempts to establish network connections as needed for its numerous autonomous network services. As a result, even if an application does not explicitly submit a network use request, the device will be in a state where it is connected to the network when network connections are available.</p>
<p>However, up to several dozen seconds or several minutes may be required to discover new wireless access points.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_195591589_h3_2">Automatically Selecting the Destination for Internet Communications</h3>
<p>When the system automatically selects the target destination for network connections, it uses the following policies in descending order of priority.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prioritize network connections that are in use.<br /><ul><li>If a network connection is already established, the system will not switch connections even if a higher priority network is available.</li><li>If a connection is selected manually in the <strong>Internet Connection</strong> options in the HOME Menu, this connection will be maintained until it is lost. As a result, automatically changing connections will not occur after this connection is specified.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Prioritize wired connections.<br /><ul><li>If both wired and wireless LAN connections are available, the system will prioritize the wired LAN connection.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Prioritize recently used connection settings.<ul><li>The system will assign a higher priority to connections that were used more recently.</li><li>As a result, the system will always select the same connection in an environment with multiple available networks.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Prioritize access points with a stronger signal.<ul><li>If multiple wireless access points are available that are compatible with the same connection settings, the device will select the access point from which it receives the strongest signal.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>As an exception, if a wired LAN connection is found while using wireless LAN, the system will disconnect from the wireless LAN network and attempt to switch over to the wired LAN so long as applications are not explicitly using the network connection. If the system is explicitly using the network connection, it will switch over to the wired LAN after usage is over.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_195591589_h3_3">Coexistence of Internet Communication and Local Communication</h3>
<p>Internet communication and local communication may not coexist. Even if the device is using Internet communication through a wired LAN connection, this Internet connection will be disconnected when it begins local communication.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_195591589_h2_3">Behavior in Individual Scenarios</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_195591589_h3_4">Connecting a USB Ethernet Adapter or LAN Cable (Docking)</h3>
<p>If the device is linked up to an Ethernet connection via a USB Ethernet adapter or LAN cable while using wireless LAN, it operates as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is no explicit network use request from applications, the system will disconnect from the wireless LAN and change over to using the wired LAN.</li>
  <li>If there are explicit network use requests from applications, the system will maintain connection with the current wireless LAN.<ul><li>However, after the explicit network use request is canceled, the system will disconnect from the wireless LAN and switch to using the wired LAN.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Connecting a USB Ethernet adapter or LAN cable without linking up to an Ethernet connection does not affect network connections, including local communication, on the device.</p>
<p>Docking the system to a dock connected to a USB Ethernet adapter is the same as connecting a USB Ethernet adapter.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_195591589_h3_5">Disconnecting a USB Ethernet Adapter or LAN Cable (Undocking)</h3>
<p>If the USB Ethernet adapter or LAN cable is disconnected while using wired LAN, the network connection will be disconnected. Afterwards, the system will automatically re-establish wireless network connection if wireless LAN settings and a wireless network are available, but network use requests submitted prior to disconnection will not be re-accepted automatically.</p>
<p>Disconnecting a USB Ethernet adapter that is not in use will not affect network connections, including local communication.</p>
<p>Undocking the system from a dock connected to a USB Ethernet adapter is the same as disconnecting a USB Ethernet adapter.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_195591589_h3_6">Connecting Multiple USB Ethernet Adapters</h3>
<p>If no USB Ethernet adapters are enabled, the connected USB Ethernet adapter will be enabled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If multiple USB Ethernet adapters are connected, the USB Ethernet adapter that was connected first will be used.</li>
  <li>If multiple USB Ethernet adapters are connected and the adapter that is enabled is disconnected, a different USB Ethernet adapter that was previously disabled will not become enabled.</li>
  <li>If a new USB Ethernet adapter is connected while only disabled USB Ethernet adapters are connected, the new adapter will be enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiple USB Ethernet adapters are connected at startup, it is not possible to predict which adapter will be enabled.</p>
<p>The LAN cable connection status will not affect the USB Ethernet adapter that is enabled.</p>
