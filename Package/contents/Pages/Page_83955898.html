<h1 id="Anchor_83955898_h1_1">Multi-Export Plug-In</h1>
<p>This section describes the use and features of the multi-export plug-in.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955898_h2_1">Features</h2>
<p>You can use the multi-export plug-in to export more than one model and more than one animation all at the same time by saving multiple export settings for a scene.</p>
<p>The multi-export plug-in exports data based on a combination of the following settings. These combinations of settings are called <em>export items</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The filename of the intermediate file to be exported</li>
  <li>The path to the folder to export intermediate files</li>
  <li>The path to the FMD file to merge</li>
  <li>The path to the FDES file to use</li>
  <li>The node name to be exported</li>
  <li>The scene layer node name to be exported</li>
  <li>The name of the effective animation layer</li>
  <li>Comment text for the intermediate file</li>
  <li>The range of use when exporting an animation</li>
  <li>A loop playback flag</li>
  <li>Export flags for each intermediate file</li>
  <li>Additional options</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Anchor_83955898_h2_2">How to Use</h2>
<p>Select <strong>Nintendo</strong> &gt; <strong>Multi Export</strong> to display the window.</p>
<p>A list of export items set for the current scene is displayed in the window that appears.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Output File Name</strong>
    <br />The name of the intermediate file to export.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>fdes File</strong>
    <br />The name of the FDES file to use.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Node</strong>
    <br />The name of the node to export.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Layer</strong>
    <br />The name of the display layer to export.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comment</strong>
    <br />Editing comments for the intermediate file.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Start End</strong>
    <br />The range of animation to export.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loop</strong>
    <br />The flag for looping playback.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Selection</strong>
    <br />Export flags for each intermediate file. The following letters are shown if they are enabled. <br />M: FMDB file<br />T: FTXB file<br />S: FSKB file<br />V: FVBB file<br />C: FCLB file<br />R: FTSB file<br />P: FTPB file<br />H: FSHB file<br />N: FSNB file</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Options</strong>
    <br />Additional options. <br />After the path of the export folder, the path of the FMD file to merge, and the name of the effective animation layer have all been set, select an option from the list to display it below the list. <br />Click <strong>Add</strong> to add new user data. If an item in the list is selected, data is inserted in the selected location; if no item is selected, data is added to the end of the list. (The selection can be canceled by clicking &quot;-----&quot; in any location where there is nothing in the listed.) <br />The setting made for an existing export item can be changed by selecting an item in the list and clicking <strong>Edit</strong> or by double-clicking the item. <br />To duplicate an item (or items), select one or more items from the list and then click  <strong>Duplicate</strong>. <br />Export items can be deleted by selecting items and clicking <strong>Delete</strong>. <br />You can change the order of export items in the list by selecting one or more items and clicking <strong>Move Up</strong> or <strong>Move Down</strong>. (The order does not effect the intermediate file being exported.) <br />Select an item in the list and click <strong>Load fdes to Scene</strong> to load the settings from the fdes file entered into the scene and display the export plug-in Options menu. (Option settings for the current scene are displayed if the path is left blank.) <br />Select an item from the list and click <strong>Get Playback Range</strong> to get the animation playback range on 3ds Max and use it to set the start frame and end frame for the export item. <br />Select an item from the list and click <strong>Set Playback Range</strong> to change the playback range of the animation used by 3ds Max so that the playback range specified by <strong>Start / End Frame</strong> for the export item is played. <br />Items selected in the list can be exported by clicking <strong>Export Selected Items</strong>. <br />You can export all export items by clicking <strong>Export All Items</strong>. <br />A window for entering export items can be brought up by clicking <strong>Add</strong> or <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Output File Name</strong>
    <br />Enter the name of the intermediate file to export (excluding the filename extension). <br />Click <strong>Scene</strong> on the right to set the current scene name. <br />Clicking <strong>Node</strong> allows you to enter a name for the node currently selected in Maya (or the first node selected if more than one is selected).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Output Folder</strong>
    <br />Enter the folder to export the intermediate files to. <br />If this setting is left blank, the settings of the FDES file are used. (If the <strong>File</strong> setting in the FDES file is also blank, the current scene's settings are used instead.) <br />If the specified path is not a full path, the system treats it as a relative path from the folder storing the current scene file.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Merge fmd File</strong>
    <br />
Merges the specified FMD files if you select this option and specify an FMD file path. <br />If the path is left blank, the export file to be overwritten is merged. <br />If the specified path is not a full path, the system treats it as a relative path from the folder storing the current scene file.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>fdes File</strong>
    <br />Enter the path to the FDES file you are using. <br />If left blank, the current scene's option settings are used for export. <br />If the specified path is not a full path, the system treats it as a relative path from the folder storing the current scene file. <br />You can select an FDES file from the history of recently imported FDES files by clicking <strong>Recent fdes</strong> at the bottom. <br />Click <strong>Load fdes to Scene</strong> to load the settings from the FDES file entered into the scene and display an export plug-in option window. (Option settings for the current scene are displayed if the path is left blank.)</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Node</strong>
    <br />Enter the name of the node to export if you are exporting data for only a particular node. (Nodes in the hierarchy below this node will also be exported.) <br />You can enter multiple node names by separating them with spaces. <br />You do not need to enter anything if the FDES file is being used to export the entire scene. <br />Conversely, only the node entered will be exported if you enter a node name even though the FDES file is set to export the entire scene. <br />Clicking <strong>Get</strong> located on the right enters the name of the node currently selected in 3ds Max.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Select</strong> to select the entered node on 3ds Max.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Layer</strong>
    <br />To export a particular layer, enter the name of that layer to export. <br />You can enter multiple layer names by separating them with spaces. <br />You do not need to enter anything if the FDES file is being used to export the entire scene. <br />But even if the entire scene is being exported, if you enter layer names here, only those layers will be exported. <br />Clicking <strong>Get</strong> located on the right enters the name of the node currently selected in 3ds Max. <br />Clicking <strong>Set</strong> makes the entered layers visible on 3ds Max.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anim Layer</strong>
    <br />To enable a particular animation layer as an active layer, enter the name here. <br />You can enter multiple animation layers by separating them with spaces. <br />Enter <strong>Base Layer</strong> to deactivate all non-base animation layers. <br />If this setting is left blank, all currently active animation layers are exported. <br />Click <strong>Get</strong> on the right to enter the name of the animation layers currently active into 3ds Max. <br />Click <strong>Set</strong> to enable only the entered animation layers on 3ds Max.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comment</strong>
    <br />Specifies comments about editing the intermediate file. <br />Comments cannot include semicolons (;) or quotation marks (&quot;).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Start / End Frame</strong>
    <br />
Specifies the range (start frame and end frame) of the animation to output. <br />This setting works the same way as the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955546.html#Anchor_83955546_animation_options">Start / End Frame</a> option of the Export plug-in.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loop</strong>
    <br />Sets the loop playback flag. <br />Select this option to export the data as looped playback data. <br />If this option is cleared, the animation range is exported as one-time playback data</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Output File Selection</strong>
    <br />Sets the export flags for the intermediate files. <br />Click <strong>Get from fdes</strong> to export only the intermediate files that are set for export using the specified FDES file in <strong>fdes File</strong>. (If the path is left blank, all intermediate files set for output in the current scene are enabled for export.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additional Options</strong>
      <br />Additional options can be specified using the same format described for <a href="../Pages/Page_83955899.html#Anchor_83955899_command_options">Using Option Strings</a>, separating them by spaces without using double quotation marks. <br />You can enter multiple options either on a single line or by using returns and entering them on multiple lines. <br />These additional options take priority over the options specified in the FDES files. <br />For example, you can enter specifications as follows if the setting for <strong>Frame Precision</strong> in the FDES file is 1.0, but you are exporting it as 0.5.<br /></p>

    <p>If the FDES file for the exported items uses presets, locked settings in the preset file have priority over export item settings. <br />For example, if the <strong>Output Folder</strong> specified by preset has been locked as <code>D:/data/</code>, data is exported to <code>D:/data/</code> even if <code>D:/tmp/</code> is set as the <strong>Output Folder</strong> for the export item. <br />The same is true for other option settings such as <strong>Merge fmd File</strong>, <strong>Start / End Frame</strong>, <strong>Loop</strong>, and <strong>Output File Selection</strong>.</p>
