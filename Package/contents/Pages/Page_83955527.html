<!-- Texture Pattern Animation -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_83955527">Texture Pattern Animation</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>Texture pattern animations are set by animating the file node <strong>Image Number</strong> (the <strong>Frame Extension</strong> attribute).</p>
<p>Select a file node, open the Attribute Editor, and then select <strong>Use Image Sequence</strong> (the <strong>Use Frame Extension</strong> attribute).</p>
<p>
  <em>Delete the expression</em> when applying a key because, currently, the default expression is automatically connected to the <strong>Image Number</strong> (the <strong>Frame Extension</strong> attribute).</p>
<p>Next, set the animation for the <strong>Image Number</strong> (<strong>Frame Extension</strong> attribute). Driven keys, expressions, and animation layers can also be used. <br />However, when expressions or animation layers are being used, and when keys are not being set directly (for example when they are being set via the utility node), you must use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955861.html">Texture Pattern Animation Setting plug-in</a> to configure the list of textures to output.</p>
<p>Set the <strong>Frame Offset</strong> attribute to 0. <br />When the following cases apply, the animation curve data is created automatically from baked data and exported.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is at least one key whose linear type is not Stepped.</li>
  <li>Driven keys, expressions, and animation layers are being used.</li>
  <li>Keys are not set directly to image numbers (Frame Extension attribute).</li>
</ul>
<p>A number that corresponds to the frame extension is applied to the names of the files used for texture pattern animation. The number appears immediately before the filename extension, as in <code><em>name</em>.<em>number</em>.tga</code>, such as <code><em>name</em>.1.tga</code>, <code><em>name</em>.2.tga</code>, <code><em>name</em>.3.tga</code>, and so on.  <br />Filenames where numbers start with a zero, such as <code>name.01.tga</code> and <code>name.001.tga</code>, are also supported. (Numbers up to four digits long can start with zeros.) For example, if two files have the names <code>name.1.tga</code> and <code>name.01.tga</code>, the texture without a 0 in the filename is exported.</p>

  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>The only textures that are exported by default are those set by using the <strong>Image Name</strong> attribute of the file node, and those that correspond to the keys that were applied to the <strong>Frame Extension</strong> attribute.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>For instance, if the <strong>Image Name</strong> is <code>name.1.tga</code> and only two keys have been applied where the <strong>Frame Extension</strong> is 1 for the start frame and 4 for the end frame, only <code>name.1.tga</code> and <code>name.4.tga</code> are output. <br /> Even if the animation curve tangents are linear, <code>name.2.tga</code> and <code>name.3.tga</code> are not output. <br />If the texture for the <strong>Frame Extension</strong> of the animation curve is not exported, the texture for the closest <strong>Frame Extension</strong> is used as the pattern animation data.</p>

  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955861.html">plug-in for setting texture patterns</a> to configure a texture to be forcibly exported.  Textures configured using this plug-in are exported even if an animation has not been set for the image number (extended frame attribute).</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>For example, if you set the forced output <strong>Frame Extension</strong> range to <strong>1-4</strong> (from 1 through 4), there will only be two-key hits with <code>Frame Extension</code> equal to 1 for the start frame and 4 for the end frame. The Tangents of the animation curves can be output as Linear.  <br /> When you use multiple FMA files (FTP files) with a single model, make sure that you use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955861.html">Texture Pattern Animation Setting plug-in</a> to configure the settings so that all necessary textures are exported.</p>

  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>If the <strong>Compress Material</strong> export option is enabled, even materials for which texture pattern color animations are not set sometimes are animated as a result of united materials.  If this happens, use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956030.html">plug-in for setting material attributes</a> to change settings so that materials for which color animation is set are not compressed.</p>
