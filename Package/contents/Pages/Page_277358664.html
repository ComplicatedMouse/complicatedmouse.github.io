<h1 id="Anchor_277358664_h1_1">Use the Versions of the SDK and Firmware That Are Approved for Master ROM Submission</h1>
<p>The version of the SDK and the firmware required for testing and master ROM submission changes periodically and according to the current release version of the SDK.<br />Test your applications using the versions of the SDK and firmware listed on the <a href="https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/g1kr9vj6/tech-info/master-submission-information">Master ROM Submission Information</a> page in the Nintendo Developer Portal.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_277358664_h1_2">Using the Controller Firmware Required for Testing </h1>
<p>The version of the controller firmware required for testing changes periodically, according to the current release version of the firmware.<br />Test your applications using the latest version of the firmware listed on the <a href="https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/g1kr9vj6/tech-info/master-submission-information">Master ROM Submission Information</a> page in the Nintendo Developer Portal.</p>
<p>For more information about the controller firmware, see the following pages in the documentation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="../Pages/Page_174241228.html">Controller Firmware Release Notes</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="../Pages/Page_310877993.html#Anchor_310877993_h3_3">DevMenu &gt; Controller Management</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the SDK version, applications that use the <code>irsensor</code> library may require a different version of the controller firmware, so a firmware update may take place while the application is running. To verify that the application can run without trouble even if the controller firmware gets updated, test the behavior of your application when the system is connected to a controller with the version of the firmware at the time of the product launch.</p>
<p>For more information about rolling back the controller firmware to the firmware at the time of the product launch, see <a href="../Pages/Page_233871004.html">Rolling Back the Controller Firmware For Debugging Purposes</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_277358664_h1_3">Using an EDEV or ADEV Set to PROD MODE</h1>
<p>EDEV and ADEV devices can be used for debugging and for using various development features such as connecting to Target Manager. However, you can disable these features and make the development hardware operate in essentially the same way as a retail unit by setting the mode to PROD MODE. As a final test, make sure that your application runs correctly on an EDEV or ADEV set to this PROD MODE.</p>
<p>See the following page for more information about PROD MODE and how to enable it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="../Pages/Page_186060673.html">Initialization for PROD MODE, the Firmware That Approximates Retail Hardware</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If a problem, such as the application stops responding, only occurs in PROD MODE, verify whether it is using development features that are not available to retail version software (such as <a href="../Pages/Page_95685000.html">htc Library</a> or <a href="../Pages/Page_161285836.html">pcm Library</a>).</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_277358664_h1_4">Using NX Development Cards</h1>
<p>When developing applications that will be distributed as card applications, always test application functionality using an NX development card.</p>
<p>This testing is not required for applications that are only sold as a downloadable version, but is required for applications that are sold in both downloadable and card versions.</p>
<!--Remove-->
<h1 id="Anchor_277358664_h1_5">Using the Appropriate Platform Region</h1>
<p>When verifying behavior, set the platform region corresponding to the sales region for the application.</p>
<p>For more information about platform region, see the following page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="../Pages/Page_698193408.html">Testing Environment</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need to verify behavior for platform regions different from the sales region.</p>
<p>For example, for applications to be sold outside of China, behavior does not need to be verified with the platform region set to China.</p>
