<!-- NX Performance Overview -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_104470764">NX Performance Overview</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The NX system uses an SoC with higher power draw and thermal output in comparison to past handheld devices. For this reason, sometimes during game development you must take power consumption and heat generation into consideration, even though you could previously ignore those factors.</p>
<p>An environment is being prepared for the NX system that will allow developers to create games just like they would for the earlier platforms without worrying about power consumption and heat generation during gameplay. However, developers must be aware of the kind of performance they can expect with their games.</p>
<p>This document describes the differences between the NX system and earlier platforms and describes how to manage the performance of the NX system.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_104470764_h1_1">Heat and Cooling</h1>
<p>The NX cooling capacity is less than the peak thermal output of the NX SoC chipset. As a result, for game stability the application must extract performance from the chips commensurate with a power consumption that falls within the scope of the cooling capacity. The specific cooling capacity and the performance to become available because of that capacity will be decided based on an evaluation of the design of the housing and measurements of game power consumption.</p>
<p>The cooling capacity differs depending on whether the system is docked and being played in TV mode using the TV as the screen, or unlocked and being played in handheld mode.</p>
<p>The game developer must choose the CPU and GPU performance based on the cooling capacity of the NX system. When choosing a performance profile for a game under development, it is important for the developer to consider how much of the capability of the CPU (or power consumption) and how much of the capability of the GPU the game will use, and then decide how to allocate processing between the two. For example, a 2D-centric game does not use the GPU very much, so more of the processing can be allocated to the CPU. In contrast, a 3D game requires extensive use of the GPU, so it is important to allocate processing in a more balanced way between the CPU and the GPU.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <u>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The preceding image shows a static allocation to non-CPU/GPU systems. Other systems will also have the ability to specify power allocation.</u>
</p>
<p>Power consumption is largely determined by the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CPU/GPU clock rate</li>
  <li>Number of active CPU cores</li>
  <li>Length of active CPU/GPU time</li>
</ul>
<p>The game developer must consider these elements to keep power consumption within the capacity of the cooling system. In some cases, the performance (power allocation) must change when changing between docked console mode and undocked handheld mode, to fit each mode's cooling capacity.</p>

  <span style="letter-spacing: 1.92px;">Choosing a Performance Profile</span>
</h1>
<p>An environment is being prepared for the NX system that will allow developers to create games without worrying about power consumption and heat generation. However, to choose between the presets described in this section, it helps to understand something about heat and power.</p>
<p>Preset clock rates and CPU core counts are designed to prevent heat-related issues with NX systems. The game developer will choose a performance profile from these preset values. These presets will keep thermal generation of the SoC within the capacity of the cooling system when the CPU/GPU are running at 100%.</p>
<p>

  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <u>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The clock rate shown in the preceding image is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect actual device values.</u>
</p>
<p>The developer must consider how to efficiently use the CPU/GPU resources to maximize the game application's performance in the Type-A environment.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104470764_h2_1">Important</h2>
<p>These preset profiles are designed to keep system performance within the cooling system's capacity even with 100 percent use of CPU and GPU time. This will leave a surplus in the heat budget of the device when the CPU and GPU are not 100 percent used.</p>
<p>The preset also caps the SoC clock rate at a lower value. This cap reduces the peak performance available to the application, even at 80 percent use of CPU/GPU time.</p>
