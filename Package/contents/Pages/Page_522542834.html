<!-- When HDEV Initialization Fails -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_522542834">When HDEV Initialization Fails</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>Factors such as the HDEV status can cause initialization to fail.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initialization fails.</li>
  <li>The HDEV console you want to initialize does not appear (or it no longer appears) on the HDEV connection list in InitializeHdevWin.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens, verify the following.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_1">Using InitializeHdev.exe (or InitializeHdevWin.exe)</h1>
<p>We recommend directly calling InitializeHdev.exe or InitializeHdevWin.exe.</p>
<p>The following files also call these functions directly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\InitializeHdev.bat</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_2">Verifying the Specified Parameters</h1>
<p>If you are using the <code>InitializeHdev.exe</code> command-line tool, verify that the specified parameters match. (The serial number works with or without a check digit.)</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_3">Repeating Initialization</h1>
<p>Sometimes initializing the HDEV several times is successful. Try to initialize again.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_4">Fully Charging the HDEV Console</h1>
<p>Try initialization after fully charging the HDEV console.</p>
<p>To charge the device you must attach the AC adapter. Note that simply connecting the USB cable does not charge the console.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_5">Reconnecting the USB Cable and Turning On the Power</h1>
<p>Try initializing the HDEV console again after reconnecting the USB cable and turning the power on.</p>
<p>If initialization is particularly unsuccessful, reconnect the USB cable with the following procedure.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disconnect the USB cable from the HDEV system.</li>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button on the upper left of the HDEV console for approximately 12 seconds to turn off the power.</li>
  <li>Reconnect the USB cable to the HDEV console while the power is off.</li>
  <li>The HDEV turns on automatically when it is connected. Try initialization again.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the device connected to a relay box, try connecting it directly to the PC without using the relay box.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_6">Exiting Target Manager if It Is Running</h1>
<p>Exit the Target Manager if it is running, and then try to initialize HDEV.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Target Manager stays in the system tray, so also check there.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_7">Verifying That the HDEV Console Is Recognized by the Device Manager</h1>
<p>Verify that the HDEV is recognized as a USB device in Device Manager.<br />For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_1226258846.html">Initializing the HDEV</a> &gt; HDEV Drivers.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_8">Manually Activating Safe Mode</h1>
<p>Sometimes initialization is successful after activating safe mode.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Safe mode is a mode that runs with minimum features.</p>
    <p>Use safe mode in the following situations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The console is not operating properly and must be restored.</li>
      <li>HDEV initialization fails.</li>
      <li>The power is on but the system menu does not appear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Safe mode can be activated with user operations.</p>
    <p>After safe mode is activated, you may not be able to start in normal mode until the EDEV is initialized, so <strong><u>we recommend using safe mode only when you must restore or initialize</u>. </strong></p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_522542834_h2_1">Entering Safe Mode</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button (<em><u>for approximately 12 seconds</u></em>) and turn off the HDEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system will restart after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)</li>
  <li>Press the buttons on the upper left of the console in the following order.<br /><ol><li>Press the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.</li><li>While holding down the POWER Button, release the volume down button and press the volume up button.</li><li>While holding down the volume up button, release the POWER Button.</li><li>Release the volume up button.</li></ol></li>
  <li>To check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, restart the process from step 1.</li>
</ol>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>For cases where the system enters the standard startup sequence and displays the menu despite attempting to enter safe mode, sometimes adjusting the intervals between button operations will fix the issue. (This is because some operations may not be detected if the intervals between button operations is too fast.)</p>
    <p>As a guide, try using an interval of 0.6 seconds. It is equivalent to 4 beat intervals at 100 beats per minute (bpm). We recommend searching for a video with &quot;BPM=100&quot; that you can use as a guide.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_522542834_h2_2">Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode</h2>
<p>Use the following procedure to verify whether the system has entered safe mode.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Press the Re-Scan button to display the systems that are in safe mode &quot;(Safe Mode)&quot; in the list of connected systems. (However, only do this when using <code>InitializeHdevWin.exe</code>.)</li>
  <li>&quot;NX DevKit Safe Mode&quot; is displayed for four seconds on the HDEV console screen.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_9">Using USB 2.0 When USB 3.0 Connection Fails</h1>
<p>HDEV setup may fail depending on the compatibility with the USB 3.0 controller.<br />Try the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update the USB 3.0 controller driver to the latest version.</li>
  <li>Update the USB 3.0 controller firmware to the latest version. (Sometimes this firmware is not publicly available.)</li>
  <li>Perform setup by connecting the device to a USB 2.0 port.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setup has been confirmed to fail when using a PC with the following USB 3.0 controller.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_522542834_h1_10">Contacting Support</h1>
<p>If initialization is unsuccessful after attempting these procedures, contact Nintendo support.</p>
<p>When contacting support, <em><u>the process will be smoother if you include the following information.</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Serial number of the HDEV unit</li>
  <li>SDK version</li>
  <li>Initialization log<ul><li>For InitializeHdevWin, copy the log that appears in the log window to a text file and send in the text file.</li><li>For InitializeHdev, execute a log with the <code>--verbose</code> option added and save it to a file.</li></ul></li>
