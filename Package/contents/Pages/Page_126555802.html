<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_1">Operation is not guaranteed when the system locale is changed to anything other than the default value.</h1>
<p>The operation when the system locale is changed to anything other than the default value is not guaranteed. (For example, if the locale is set to anything other than &quot;Japanese [Japan]&quot; in the Japanese version of Windows.)</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_1">The Find Result page for the NintendoSDK API Reference Manual does not work correctly in the Microsoft Help Viewer.</h2>
<p>The Find Result page for the NintendoSDK API Reference Manual does not work correctly in Microsoft Help Viewer. If you try to use it, you cannot enter anything in the text box, making search impossible.</p>
<p>Use a web browser to use the Find Result page.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_3">HTCS Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_2">When htcs::Initialize is called while Target Manager is not running, the function is blocked until a connection with Target Manager is established.</h2>
<p>When <code>htcs::Initialize</code> is called while Target Manager is not running, the function is blocked until a connection with Target Manager is established.</p>
<p>We plan to change this function in the future, so that the call is successful regardless of the connection status with Target Manager. </p>

<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_4">Audio-Related</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_3">Exporting sound waveforms does not work in NintendoWare SoundMaker and SoundProjectWaveExporter.</h2>
<p>Attempts to export sound waveforms using the NintendoWare tools SoundMaker and SoundProjectWaveExporter always result in the creation of blank waveform files.</p>
<p>This problem will be corrected in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_4">When you convert a sound project imported using NintendoWare's SoundMaker, an invalid sound archive is exported.</h2>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">When, in SoundMaker, an NW4C/NW4F sound project (one for which the cache file remains for converting purposes) is imported and (normally) converted, NW4C/NW4F binary source files become mixed in with the NintendoSDK binary sound archive (BFSAR) files. As a result, they cannot be correctly read during the <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> and <code>nw::snd</code> runtimes. This is a problem.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);"> </span>The workaround is to make sure that you reconvert the sound project after importing it. This makes the old cache file unusable, which avoids the problem.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_5">If some of the parameters in Biquad filter are set, the audio may be cut off.</h2>
<p>If the following parameters are set in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundHandle__SetBiquadFilter">nn::atk::SoundHandle::SetBiquadFilter</span>()</code> or <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundPlayer__SetBiquadFilter">nn::atk::SoundPlayer::SetBiquadFilter</span>()</code>, audio from some sources may be cut off.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the filter in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__BiquadFilterType_LowPassFilter">nn::atk::BiquadFilterType_LowPassFilter</span></code> is selected and the value is set to <code>1.0</code></li>
  <li>When the filter in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__BiquadFilterType_HighPassFilter">nn::atk::BiquadFilterType_HighPassFilter</span></code> is selected and the value is set to <code>0.1</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_6">Sometimes effects are not processed in the order in which they were added in nn::audio.</h2>
<p>The intended specification is for effects to be processed in the order in which they were added to <code>SubMix</code> or <code>FinalMix</code>. However, if you have two or more effects registered to a single <code>SubMix</code> or <code>FinalMix</code>, and you then delete an effect and add another new effect, the effects are sometimes run in the wrong order.</p>
<p>You can avoid this problem by deleting all effects from <code>SubMix</code> and <code>FinalMix</code> and then adding the effects.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_7">When I use nn::atk::viewer, a MemoryPool warning is displayed.</h2>
<p>
  <code>
    <span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__viewer">nn::atk::viewer</span>
  </code> does not currently support <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__audio__MemoryPoolType">nn::audio::MemoryPoolType</span></code>. As a result, if you use <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__viewer">nn::atk::viewer</span></code> to set wave sounds or sequence sounds as in-game editing targets and then play the sounds, the following warning message is displayed on the console.</p>
<div style="border-width: 1px;" class="preformatted panel">
  <div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
    <pre>[nn::audio] A memory pool has not been created. Using a memory pool is recommended.
[nn::audio] Please prepare nn::audio::MemoryPoolType. See the nn::audio documents.
</pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>This also happens in the AtkPlayer and AtkViewer samples. For more information about memory pools, see the section about memory pools in the <code>audio</code> library manual.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_8">Using the feature for loading waveforms individually in nn::atk causes a memory destruction failure.</h2>
<p>When using the feature for individually loading waveform archives in <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code>, the process for detaching the memory pool will sometimes fail due to when the memory is freed, causing the program to crash.</p>
<p>This will be fixed in the next release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_9">Finalizing nn::atk while an Opus stream sound is playing causes the process to stop with an assertion.</h2>
<p>Finalizing <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> while an Opus stream sound is playing causes the process to stop with an assertion.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_10">Playing several nn::atk Opus stream sounds at the same time generates audio noise.</h2>
<p>Playing several <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> Opus stream sounds at the same time generates audio noise. This bug can also be reproduced by doing the same thing in the AtkPlayer and AtkOpus samples.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_11">I cannot use multiple instances of AudioRenderer at the same time in a Windows environment.</h2>
<p>I cannot use multiple instances of <code>AudioRenderer</code> at the same time in a Windows environment.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_12">NintendoWare AtkPlayer can stop running if you change the DelayTimeMax value.</h2>
<p>The application can stop running if you change the <code>DelayTimeMax</code> parameter for the <code>Delay</code> effect in the AtkPlayer Effect panel.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_13">Reloading a sound archive in NintendoWare AtkPlayer causes the application to crash.</h2>
<p>After editing a stream sound in NintendoWare SoundMaker and converting the sound archive file, reloading the archive in AtkPlayer sometimes causes the application to crash.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_14">Switching the sound in NintendoWare AtkPlayer sometimes causes the application to freeze or crash.</h2>
<p>While a sound is playing in the AtkPlayer <strong>SoundArchivePlayer</strong> panel, switching to another sound sometimes causes the application to freeze or crash. If the application freezes, try waiting a few moments for it to become responsive again. If the application crashes, restart the application. For now, this problem can be avoided by making sure no sounds are playing when you switch to another sound and by not switching between sounds too frequently.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_15">Finalizing the nn::atk library immediately after initialization causes the process to stop with an assertion.</h2>
<p>Finalizing <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk">nn::atk</span></code> immediately after initializing <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundSystem">nn::atk::SoundSystem</span></code> or <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__atk__SoundArchivePlayer">nn::atk::SoundArchivePlayer</span></code> causes the process to stop with an assertion. For now, this problem can be avoided by making sure to wait for a few moments after initialization before finalizing the library.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_16">The process for freeing nn::atk::SoundHeap objects sometimes takes a long time.</h2>
<p>If you try to free a <code>SoundHeap</code> after loading a large amount of data into it, the deallocation process sometimes takes a long time to complete.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in a future release.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_5">FS Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_17">When nn::fs::ReadDirectory() is called for the root directory of a drive, sometimes the first entry is not listed.</h2>
<p>There is a bug where sometimes the first entry is not listed when <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__fs__ReadDirectory">nn::fs::ReadDirectory</span>()</code> is called via <code><span class="ApiLink_nn__fs__MountHost">nn::fs::MountHost</span>()</code>/<code>MountHostRoot()</code> immediately below a drive when the target is a type of removable media.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_6">HID Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_18">An exception is thrown when the USB gamepad is detached during use in the Windows 8.1 environment.</h2>
<p>When the USB gamepad is removed during use in the Windows 8.1 environment, an exception is thrown and the program may stop.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_7">Perf Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_19">The PerfSimple sample crashes in certain PC environments.</h2>
<p>The PerfSimple sample exits with an assertion in certain PC environments.</p>
<p>This bug will be fixed in a future release.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_126555802_h1_8">ui2d font Bugs</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_20">Alpha Test does not work.</h2>
<p>Alpha Test does not work in this package.</p>
<p>We plan to fix this problem in an upcoming release.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_126555802_h2_21">Texture display cannot be performed correctly for LayoutViewer in some graphics driver environments.</h2>
<p>In some graphics driver environments, the textures in LayoutViewer are not displayed correctly. (We have seen this bug in the Quadro2000 driver 341.05 environment.)</p>
