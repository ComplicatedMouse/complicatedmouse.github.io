<h1 id="Anchor_298160983_h1_1">Overview</h1>
<p>On-card downloadable content is downloadable content that is stored on a game card.</p>
<p>It is written to the game card, together with the body of the application.</p>
<p>It can be accessed from the game program by using the same functions as normal downloadable content. No special processing is needed in the application.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>On-card downloadable content and normal downloadable content have the following differences.</p>
<table class="wrapped">
  <colgroup>

<p>For the full versions of games that use downloadable content, it is assumed that the game cards will be sold as &quot;sets&quot; containing both the body of the game and the downloadable content.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_298160983_h1_2">Important Information</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_298160983_h2_1">No Updates for On-Card Downloadable Content</h2>
<p>Unlike for the downloadable content purchased on Nintendo eShop, you cannot distribute updated versions of on-card downloadable content.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you want to update the content, you must do so by distributing an application patch.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_298160983_h2_2">Unintended Changes in Card Size and Operating Frequency</h2>
<p>Because patches and downloadable content can be included on the same game card as the application, the card size and operating frequency may differ from a card that only contains the application.</p>
<p>For more information about the relationship between card size and operating frequency, see <a href="../Pages/Page_177655843.html">NX Development Card</a>.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>The required card size is calculated automatically when you create the NSP file for on-card downloadable content. However, there may be cases where you expect the card size to change later, or you want to specify an operating frequency. If you want to specify the card size and the operating frequency on your own, you can use the <code>--cardsize</code> option of <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a>.</p>
<p>The capacity and operating frequency of the NX game card in production is determined based on the settings in the NSP file that is submitted for the on-card downloadable content. Make sure to configure theses settings appropriately, and test operations before submitting the NSP file.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_298160983_h1_3">Tool Required for Creating On-Card Downloadable Content</h1>
<p>Requires <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a> from NX Add-On 4.5.0 and later, or from NX Add-On 5.2.0 or later.</p>
<p>II you use an earlier version of <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a>, an error occurs during submission.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_298160983_h1_4">NSP Files Required to Create On-Card Downloadable Content</h1>
<p>The following NSP files are required for creating on-card downloadable content.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>An NSP file for the downloadable content included on the game card. (Multiple files can be specified.)</li>
  <li>An NSP file for the application that uses the downloadable content.</li>
  <li>NSP files or the application patches that are described later (as necessary).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are creating data for submission on the Nintendo Developer Portal, these NSP files must have all passed Lotcheck.<br />If you are using the NSP files to test operations in the development environment without submitting the files, it does not matter whether they have passed Lotcheck.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>If, for your on-card downloadable content, you must exclude certain indexes of content from an NSP file that has already passed Lotcheck, use the <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html#Anchor_107320233_splitnsp">splitnsp command</a> of <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a>.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_298160983_h1_5">Checking Behavior in the Development Environment</h1>
<p>To verify behavior in the development environment, game cards must be created and on-card downloadable content must have been written to them.</p>
<p>Because the application appears as if it is installing normal downloadable content when a game card on which on-card downloadable content has been written is inserted, you can check the behavior in the same way as when installing normal downloadable content.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Use the following procedure to create a game card on which on-card downloadable content has been written.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>Take the NSP file for the downloadable content and the NSP file for the application or patch, and convert them together to an NSP file for the on-card downloadable content.</li>
  <li>Write both the NSP file for the on-card downloadable content, and the NSP file for the application or patch, to a game card.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe the steps in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_298160983_h2_3">Converting to an On-Card Downloadable Content NSP File</h2>
<p>The NSP file for downloadable content cannot be written to a game card as is.</p>
<p>However, you can use the <code>convertaoc</code> command of <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a> to create an NSP file for on-card downloadable content that can be written to the game card.</p>
<p>To complete this procedure, you need the NSP file for the application or patch that will be using this downloadable content.</p>
<p>For example, the following command can be used to convert the file. This command creates an NSP file for on-card downloadable content named <code>output.nsp</code> in the <code>OutputDir</code> directory.</p>
<table class="codeblock">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <div class="codeblock"><pre># App.nsp is the NSP file for the application that will use the downloadable content.
# (If there is a patch, use the --base option to specify the NSP file for the latest patch, and not for the application itself.)
# Aoc.nsp is the NSP file for the downloadable content.

$ AuthoringTool.exe convertaoc -o OutputDir --base App.nsp Aoc.nsp</pre></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>You can specify downloadable content and applications created using SDK versions earlier than NX Add-On 5.2.0.</p>
<p>For advanced options, see the <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a> reference.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_298160983_h2_4">Writing to a Game Card</h2>
<p>Write the NSP file for the on-card downloadable content, and the NSP file for the application or patch that will use that add-on content, to a game card.</p>
<p>Use RunOnTarget to pass a command such as the following to DevMenuCommand. This command writes the NSP file for the on-card downloadable content, and the NSP file for the application that will use that downloadable content, to a game card.</p>
<p>Applications and patches created using SDK versions prior to NX Add-On 5.2.0 can be specified here.</p>
<table class="codeblock">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <div class="codeblock"><pre># D:\App.nsp is the NSP file for the application that will be using this downloadable content.
# D:\Aoc.nsp is the NSP file for the on-card downloadable content.
# D:\Patch.nsp is the NSP file for a patch.

$ RunOnTarget.exe DevMenuCommand.nsp -- gamecard write D:\App.nsp --on-card-patch D:\Patch.nsp --on-card-aoc D:\Aoc.nsp</pre></div>
      </td>
    </tr>

<p>If necessary, also refer to the following page.</p>
<p>
  <a href="../Pages/Page_166051528.html">Writing to NX Development Cards</a>
</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_298160983_h1_6">Submitting</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_298160983_h2_5">NSP File for Submission</h2>
<p>The only NSP file you must submit is the NSP file for the on-card downloadable content that you created using the conversion procedure described earlier.</p>
<p>However, note that the NSP files for the application, patch, and downloadable content that you passed to <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a> when this NSP file was created must have already passed Lotcheck.</p>
<p>An error will occur if the NSP file you submit was created using NSP files that have not passed Lotcheck.</p>
<p>As long as the application, patch, and downloadable content NSP files have passed Lotcheck, using a version of NX Add-On that would have been prohibited for past submissions is now acceptable.</p>
