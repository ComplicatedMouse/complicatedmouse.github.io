<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_83955728">Project Tree</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_83955728_h1_1">Project Tree</h1>
<p>This section provides an overview of sound projects and a description of project trees.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955728_h2_1">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_1">Role of the Project Tree</h3>
<p>The project tree is where sound sets are registered to sound projects.</p>
<p>Select nodes in the sound set to display a list of them in the tab pane.</p>
<p>You can archive multiple sound sets by adding them to a folder. </p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_2">Structure of Sound Projects</h3>
<p>You can register more than one sound set with a sound project.<br />You can also register bank files, waveform files, and standard MIDI files in the sound sets for use as sound resources.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Bank</strong> tab to open and edit bank files that have not yet been registered in the sound project.<br />There are two kinds of bank files in SoundMaker: (1) registered bank files that are subject to conversion, and (2) bank files that open but are not unregistered and are not converted.<br />Within this documentation, the word <em>project</em> refers to the former type; that is, those files that are subject to conversion. Likewise, the term <em>workspace</em> refers to all files that are displayed within SoundMaker, including any unregistered files that may be open.</p>
<p>For more information about how to load bank files that are not registered in a project, see <a href="../Pages/Page_83955542.html#Anchor_83955542_ext_prj_bankfile">Loading Bank Files from Outside the Project</a>.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="Anchor_83955728_h2_2">Key Operations</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_3">Project Tree Keyboard Operations</h3>
<p>In addition to the menu <strong>Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Project Tree</strong> and the toolbar <strong>Project Tree Display</strong> button, you can also use the ALT+1 shortcut key to enable or disable the project tree display option.</p>
<p>You can perform the following keyboard operations inside the project tree.</p>
<ul>
  <li>UP/DOWN ARROW keys &mdash; Move the selected node up or down.</li>
  <li>LEFT ARROW &mdash; Close node. If the node is already closed, move to the parent node.</li>
  <li>RIGHT ARROW &mdash; Open node. If the node is already open, move to the first child node.</li>
  <li>BACKSPACE &mdash; Keep the node open and move to the parent node.</li>
  <li>PAGE UP/DOWN &mdash; Scroll one page up or down.</li>
  <li>HOME/END &mdash; Move to the top or bottom of the tree.</li>
  <li>ENTER &mdash; The same operation as a double-click.</li>
  <li>DELETE &mdash; Delete the selected item.</li>
  <li>SHIFT + Mouse wheel &mdash; Scroll left and right.</li>
  <li>Application key &mdash; Show the shortcut menu (this key is not present on all keyboards).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955728_h2_3">Tree View</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_4">Synchronize With Tabs</h3>
<p>Select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Synchronize Trees to Tabs</strong> to synchronize the node selection in the project tree with the tabs.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955728_h4_1">When the Sound Set Tab Is Active</h4>
<p>Selects the node in the project tree that corresponds to the list that is currently displayed on the active <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab.<br />After this operation, the focus moves to the tree.<br />If a corresponding tree node happens to be closed or located where not shown in the project tree, the node is opened, or the display scrolls to show the node on the screen.<br />Nothing happens if the corresponding tree node cannot be identified (that is, no tabs are open).</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955728_h4_2">When the Bank Tab Is Active</h4>
<p>Selects the node in the project tree that corresponds to the location where the active <strong>Bank</strong> tab is opened.<br />Nothing happens if the <strong>Bank</strong> tab is open, but the original bank item has been deleted from the sound set.<br />If the tab is reopened from a bank that references the same bank file, the project tree view synchronizes with the tab opened last. (Synchronizes to the most recently accessed bank node.)<br />Other operations are the same as the <strong>Sound Set</strong> tab.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_5">View Filters</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955728_h4_3">Filtering by Unused Nodes</h4>
<p>Child nodes in the sound set that are not being used can be hidden in the project tree.</p>
<p>To hide the display of child nodes, right-click a sound set node in the project tree to open the shortcut menu, and then select <strong>Hide Empty Nodes</strong>. Select this option again to show the nodes.</p>
<p>You can also apply the <strong>Hide Empty Nodes</strong> setting for all sound sets by selecting <strong>Hide All Empty Nodes</strong> from the shortcut menu used for project nodes.</p>
<p>If an item is added to an empty node while the hide setting is enabled, the node tree display is immediately restored.<br />However, if the parent node of this node is closed or positioned off the screen, it does not automatically open the parent node or scroll to show it on the screen.<br />The show/hide setting is saved for each sound set in the settings file for the project.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_83955728_h4_4">Filtering by Character Input</h4>
<p>You can filter to display specific sound set nodes when you enter text in the text boxes that appear above the Project Tree.<br />Nodes will appear for the file when that entered text includes at least a part of the name for the sound sets, wave sound sets, sequence sound sets, or sound set banks that appear as nodes in the Project Tree.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_6">Close All Nodes</h3>
<p>To close and collapse all nodes in a project tree, select <strong>Collapse All</strong> from the shortcut menu after right-clicking in a project tree.</p>
<p>The default setting is to expand all nodes in a project tree. This setting can become cumbersome when the tree has a large number of sound sets.<br />In that case, close all nodes with <strong>Collapse All</strong>, and then open only the necessary sound sets to perform operations.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955728_h3_7">Minimize View</h3>
<p>Click <strong>Minimize</strong> on the right side of the title bar of the project tree to minimize the display and show only the tab portion of the project tree.</p>
<p>To restore the project tree to its original size, click the button on the tab or double-click the tab.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955728_h2_4">Using Folders to Archive Sound Sets</h2>
<p>To create a folder in the project tree, you can right-click a project in the project tree, and from the shortcut menu, select <strong>Add Folder</strong>. </p>
<p>You can visibly manage multiple sound sets by dragging sound sets to a folder. </p>
<p>You can also drag folders to other folders.</p>
