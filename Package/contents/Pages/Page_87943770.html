  <strong>This document is a graphical introduction to the features that were added in NintendoSDK 0.6.0.</strong>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_87943770_h2_1">New Effect Expressions</h2>
<p>This section introduces features that broaden the scope of what can be depicted with effects.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_87943770_h3_1">Scale Fade</h3>
<p>Added scale fade when executing termination processing!</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_1">Usage Examples</h4>
<p>Termination processing can set the behavior when executing processing (Fade command) to force emissions from the emitter to be stopped on the developer side.<br />The newly added &quot;scale fade&quot; is a feature by which a particle gradually becomes smaller and then disappears over the time set in <strong>Fadeout Time</strong>.</p>
<p>The following figure compares what happens when the various Termination Processing settings are selected or cleared.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_87943770_h3_2">Feature Improvements to the Equal Division Emitter Shape</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Emission Type</strong> was added to <strong>Emitter Shapes</strong> with <strong>(evenly divided)</strong> in the preset name.<br />Also, <strong>Number of divisions</strong> was added to <strong>Circle (evenly divided)</strong> and <strong>Line (evenly divided)</strong>.<br />With this improvement, the <strong>Number of divisions</strong> and <strong>Number of emissions</strong> can be separately specified when the <strong>Emission Type</strong> is <strong>Random</strong> or <strong>By Index</strong>.</p>
<p>The following settings are for <strong>Circle (evenly divided)</strong>. The portion in the red frame includes the items added this time.</p>

  </span>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_2">Example of a Together Emission Type</h4>
<p>When the <strong>Emission Type</strong> is <strong>Together</strong>, all locations divided into <strong>Number of divisions</strong> emit particles at the same time.<br />Using the example of the <strong>Number of divisions</strong> set to 6, a circle emitter is divided into six divisions as follows, and particles are emitted from all locations at the same time every time.</p>

  </span>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_3">Example of Random Emission Type</h4>
<p>When the <strong>Emission Type</strong> is <strong>Random</strong>, particles are randomly emitted every time from a number of locations set with <strong>Emission rate</strong> when the locations are divided into the <strong>Number of divisions</strong>.<br />Using the example of the <strong>Number of divisions</strong> set to 6 and the <strong>Emission rate</strong> set to 2, two randomly selected locations from the six divisions emit every time, as follows.</p>
<p>

  </span>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_4">Example of By Index Emission Type</h4>
<p>Particles are emitted every time from a number of locations set with <strong>Emission rate</strong> in the order that the locations were divided using the <strong>Number of divisions</strong>.<br />Using the example of the <strong>Number of divisions</strong> set to 6 and the <strong>Emission rate</strong> set to 2, two locations from the six divisions emit at a time in order, as follows.</p>

    <p>The following notes are about compatibility.<br />The emission rate is a fixed value for <strong>Circle (evenly divided)</strong> and <strong>Line (evenly divided)</strong> for emitter Shapes and data using emission rate animation.<br />Also, the value the emission rate at the beginning of the animation is inherited by <strong>Number of divisions</strong> as a fixed value.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_87943770_h3_3">Setting a Constant Texture Density</h3>
<p>Added a <strong>Set a Constant Texture Density</strong> feature to display the texture display size in the same size, unaffected by the particle scale.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_5">Usage Examples</h4>
<p>When particles are scale animated, the animation is not influenced by the particle texture coordinates.<br />For example, this feature may be used in the physical fitness cage as shown in the figure, or to display above a game character's head in 3D space.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_87943770_h3_4">Limit Scaling in Front of Camera</h3>
<p>The <strong>Limit Scale in Front of Camera</strong> feature applies a limit to the scaling of particles.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_6">Usage Examples</h4>
<p>In the following example of using the <strong>Limit Scale in Front of Camera</strong> feature, <strong><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">A</span></strong> is the emitter before the effect is applied, and <strong><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">B</span></strong> is the emitter after the effect is applied.<br />This feature can reduce rendering costs by controlling particle visibility based on proximity to the camera.  <br /> By using this feature with the <strong>Near Alpha</strong> feature, the particle transparency can be changed and disappear naturally as it approaches the camera.</p>
<p>

  </span>
</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_87943770_h3_5">GPU Noise</h3>
<p>Added <strong>GPU Noise</strong> that allows regulated movement that appears to be random in the field.<br />Particles move on a trajectory (the waveform) determined at the time of emission.<br />For this reason, the trajectories on which the particles move can, to an extent, be more controlled than the <strong>Random</strong> field.</p>
<p>The waveform that defines the trajectory of movement of a particle is formed from a combination of four waveform components.<br />In the following figure, two waveforms are added together to form a single waveform. The particles move on this waveform.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955557/83080692.gif" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_87943770_h4_7">Usage Examples</h4>
<p>In the following example, <strong>GPU Noise</strong> is used for the movement of a group of fish moving along a determined trajectory and on the wobbling motion of rising bubbles along with scale animation expansion and contraction.<br />Because it is difficult to control with the <strong>Random</strong> field, sometimes animations probably have long dimensions such as groups of fish where the animation goes off screen and does not return.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_87943770_h3_8">Infinite Lifespan Is Limited Only When One Time Settings Are Enabled</h3>
<p>Placed limitations so that <strong>Infinite lifespan</strong> functions only when the emission setting <strong>One Time</strong> is enabled.<br />This prevents an user from increasing the number of particles in a game application unintentionally by a mistaken operation such as carelessly disabling the <strong>One Time</strong> setting.</p>
