<!--Remove-->
<h6 id="Anchor_1210038374_h6_61">Symptoms</h6>
<p>When the NX Add-On is installed using NDI, the NVIDIA graphics driver that is selected by default is the latest version of the driver that is compatible with x64 applications that use NVN. That version is not compatible with Win32 applications that use NVN, so those applications crash.</p>
<h6 id="Anchor_1210038374_h6_62">Workaround</h6>
<p>To get around this problem, install a version of the NVIDIA graphics driver that is compatible with both the x64 and Win32 versions. The NVIDIA graphics driver versions that run with both x64 and Win32 are listed in Operating Environment &gt; Software Versions at Times of SDK Releases.</p>
<p>If you are using NVN with a Win32 application, refer to the NVN Driver column in the table in Software Versions at Times of SDK Releases to determine the NVIDIA graphics driver that corresponds to the NX Add-On version you are using, and then select that version in <strong>Manage Details</strong> on NDI to install the right driver.</p>
<h6 id="Anchor_1210038374_h6_63">Fix Schedule</h6>
<p>This issue does not occur in SDK 13.0.0 and later because when the NX Add-On is installed, the latest version of the NVIDIA graphics driver that is compatible with both x64 and Win32 is selected by default.</p>

  <li>The TX1 versions of the <code>glslc</code> library may produce slightly different machine code from the Windows version, resulting in potential performance differences. The code produced on both platforms is likely to be functionally correct, and the two will converge in future releases.</li>
  <li>16-bit floating point values are supported in GLSL using <code>mediump/lowp</code> precision qualifiers with the extension <code>__GL_NV_desktop_mediump_lowp</code>, or by using explicit <code>float16</code> types with the <code>NV_gpu_shader5</code> extension.  When using the extension <code>GL_NV_desktop_mediump_lowp</code> with <code>mediump</code> and <code>lowp</code> qualifiers, the following known issues occur.<br /><ul><li>Mixing interface attribute types between shader stages with <code>explicit NV_gpu_shader5</code> <code>float16</code> types on one side of the interface and <code>mediump/lowp</code> types on the other side of the interface may produce linker errors.</li><li>Using <code>explicit NV_gpu_shader5</code> <code>float16</code> types for interface attributes between two shader stages produces a linker error.</li><li><code>int</code> and <code>uint</code> types cannot be implicitly converted to <code>float</code> types with <code>mediump/lowp</code> qualifiers.  You can work around this problem by explicitly constructing <code>float</code> types from the <code>int</code> or <code>uint</code> variables (similar to explicit casting in C/C++).  This issue currently affects GLSL shaders using <code>GL_NV_desktop_mediump_lowp</code> and ES shaders regardless of whether the extension <code>GL_EXT_shader_implicit_conversions</code> is used.</li><li>Using FP16 math to compute the data argument for <code>imageStore()</code> GLSL function calls may result in corruption in the stored data. This issue is being investigated and will be fixed in an upcoming release.</li></ul></li>

<ul>
  <li>While RenderDoc is saving a large capture to disk, there is no progress indicator. Worse, if the captured application is closed on the Nintendo Switch while the save is still in progress, the saved capture will be corrupted. Large saves can sometimes take a few seconds to finish. The only indication that the thumbnail save is complete is a subtle one: before the save is finished the thumbnail label is followed by &quot;(Remote),&quot; but after the save is finished the &quot;(Remote)&quot; disappears.</li>
  <li>The RenderDoc layer adds considerable overhead to Vulkan API calls, so programs that make many such calls run slower with the layer enabled. We have seen as much as a 10x slowdown with some large complicated programs.</li>
  <li>RenderDoc sometimes crashes when running Python scripts.</li>
  <li>When capturing from an OpenGL project, there is a significant performance penalty for using persistent mapped buffers.</li>
