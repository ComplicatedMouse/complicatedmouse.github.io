<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_758198777_h1_1">Functions</h1>
<p>The following is a list of special functions that the profiler GUI will display. A function is special if it is constructed inside the GUI rather than being read out of a module.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_1">UNRESOLVED</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>UNRESOLVED</strong>, the profiler is not able to map the function's address to a module (one of the NSS or NRS files). In <strong>Callstack</strong> profiles, <strong>UNRESOLVED</strong> functions are typically due to either callstack frames not being enabled or corrupted frame data. In <strong>Leaf Only</strong> profiles, these&nbsp;should generally not occur.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000000.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_2">&lt;Module&gt;_internal (unresolved)</h2>
<p>Functions in this form, for example &quot;nnSdk.nss_internal (unresolved)&quot;, are functions that are attributable to a specific module, but for which the profiler was unable to find a function symbol. This is common for SDK-provided modules, such as nnSdk.nss, as these modules usually remove their internal function symbols.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_3">System Idle Thread</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>System Idle Thread</strong>, it means that when the profiler took a sample, the thread running at the time was the system-level idle thread.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000001.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_4">SYSTEM THREAD</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>SYSTEM THREAD</strong>, it means that some system-level thread that is not the <strong>System Idle Thread</strong> was running at the time that sampling occurred. This is similar to the &quot;SYSTEM: &lt;Function&gt;&quot; special function listed below, but it was not possible for the profiler to map the system call back to a specific function or thread.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000004.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_5">SYSTEM: &lt;Function&gt;</h2>
<p>Any function starting with the string &quot;SYSTEM:&quot; is a function that is in the process of making a system call. If taking a <strong>Callstack</strong> profile, the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab can be used to look at the callstack to determine what kind of system calls are being made.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_6">Other Process</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>Other Process</strong>, it means that some other process was running on the core and when the profiler took a sample, that other process was the one running. For standard applications, this function will generally not occur.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000003.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_7">BAD FRAME POINTER</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>BAD FRAME POINTER</strong>, it means that while walking the callstack frames, a frame pointer existed that jumped outside of the current stack. These are typically due to either callstack frames not being enabled or corrupted frame data. This function type should only occur in <strong>Callstack</strong> profiles. All functions under this node in the <strong>Call Tree</strong>, except the leaf function, are possibly invalid.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000005.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_8">SENTINEL SAVE</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>SENTINEL SAVE</strong>, it is due to running out of space in the current buffer while walking the callstack frame. This function type should only occur in callstack profiles, and should only occur occasionally. The functions under the node in the <strong>Call Tree</strong> are still valid.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000006.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_9">UNKNOWN STACK DETAILS</h2>
<p>If a function is marked <strong>UNKNOWN STACK DETAILS</strong>, it means that some unknown problem has occurred while reading the callstack on the PC. In general, this function should not occur.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this function is given a fixed address of&nbsp;0x00000002.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198777_h1_2">Threads</h1>
<p>The following is a list of the special threads that the profiler GUI will display. A thread is considered special if it is constructed inside the GUI rather than being one of the active threads in the profiled application.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_10">System Idle Thread</h2>
<p>The <strong>System Idle Thread</strong> is a system-level thread that runs when no other thread on the core can be scheduled.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this thread is given a fixed thread id of 0x00000000.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_11">SYSTEM THREAD</h2>
<p>Any thread marked <strong>SYSTEM THREAD</strong> is a system-level thread that was not the <strong>System Idle Thread</strong>.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this thread is given a fixed thread id of 0x00000001.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198777_h2_12">Other Process</h2>
<p>If any other process has a thread running on a core, it is possible that the thread may be sampled. The profiler is not capable of determining what the other process is, so any and all other processes are included as a single grouping per core in&nbsp;<strong>Other Process</strong>. For standard applications, this thread will generally not occur.</p>
<p>In the GUI, this thread is given a fixed thread id of 0x00000002.</p>
