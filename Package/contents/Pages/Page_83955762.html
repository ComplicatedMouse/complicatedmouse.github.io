<h2 id="Anchor_83955762_h2_2">Editing a Player</h2>
<p>Players are edited by using the player list.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955762_h2_3">Elements of a Player List</h2>
<p>This section describes the meaning of each of the elements that defines a player list.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955762_h3_1">Name</h3>
<p>Specifies the name of the player.</p>
<p>The characters that can be used in a name are restricted. The following characters can be used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single-byte alphabetic characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for the first character</li>
  <li>Single-byte alphanumeric characters and the underscore [a-z, A-Z, _] for subsequent characters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955762_h3_2">Sound Limit</h3>
<p>Specifies the number of sounds that can be played simultaneously by the player.</p>
<p>If the player receives a request for a sound that exceeds the maximum number of playable sounds specified by this value, the sounds played are selected based on the player priority of each sound. Sounds left out because of this selection stop regardless of whether they are actually voiced. <br />Note that it is the priority of virtual voices, not physical voices, that matters in this specification.</p>
<p>This value specifies the maximum number of sounds, such as a sequence sound or a wave sound. <br />Although multiple MIDI channels and voices exist for each sound, priority settings for these separate voices are carried out based on channel priority. Channel priority is applied at the voice level at the point where each sound is about to be played as a physical voice.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83955762_h3_3">Heap Size</h3>
<p>Specifies the size of the player heap.</p>
<p>For more information about the player heap, see About the Player Heap.</p>
