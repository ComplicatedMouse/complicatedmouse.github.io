<h1 id="Anchor_83955542_h1_1">File Operations</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955542_h2_1">Opening Folders</h2>
<p>Select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Folder</strong> to start Windows Explorer and open a folder.</p>
<p>From Windows Explorer, you can open the folders of reference files for selected regions, instruments that reference waveform files, and items in the sound set that have waveform files, standard MIDI files, or other external reference files.</p>
<p>The only new files that you can create by using SoundMaker are sound project files, sound set files, and bank files.<br />SoundMaker does not delete files except when a newly created file overwrites an old one.<br />Use this feature when you want to save project files under another name or when you want to organize and check waveform files.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955542_h2_2">Reloading Project Files</h2>
<p>To reload project files that were edited outside SoundMaker, select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Reload Project</strong>.<br />The load targets are sound set files (FSST files) and bank files (FBNK files).</p>
<p>Reloading references the sound project, and checks every individual file to confirm that it is a target file.<br />The reloading method depends upon whether there are unsaved edits in SoundMaker.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">Case 1: When there is no update (that is, unsaved edits) in SoundMaker</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.0px;">Loads the newest file.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">Case 2: When there is an update (unsaved edits) in SoundMaker</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.0px;">Confirms by using a dialog box, and then loads the newest file.<br />When this file is loaded, the unsaved edits in SoundMaker are lost.<br />Also in this case, the undo history in the corresponding pane is cleared.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.0px;">If the task is canceled in the dialog box, nothing is done if the file has not been updated.<br />(The next time the file is saved in SoundMaker, the changed file overwrites the existing file in SoundMaker.)</p>
<p>The CTRL+L shortcut has been assigned to <strong>Reload Project</strong>.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955542_h2_3">Loading Bank Files From Outside the Project</h2>
<p>To open and edit bank files (FBNK files) that are not registered in the project, select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open File</strong>.<br />The <strong>Open File</strong> submenu is available only when a project is open.</p>
<p>You can also open an unregistered bank file by dragging the file to a view other than a bank list view.<br />If you drag the bank file to the bank list view, the bank file is added to the bank list.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955542_h2_4">Drag-Loading an External File</h2>
<p>Supports loading files by dragging project files and waveform files to the application window (including sub windows).</p>
<p>When external files are dragged to the application window, a [+] is displayed in the mouse pointer.<br />When a file is dragged to a list or the Sample Map, the insert location is highlighted.</p>
<p>An error appears when a file that cannot be registered is dragged to a list.<br />During the selection and loading of several files, if there are illegal files, only the valid files are registered, and a single error appears for all of the illegal files.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955542_h2_5">Warning When Registering a File That Is Outside of the Project Folder</h2>
<p>If you attempt to register a file that is outside of the project folder, a warning dialog box appears to confirm whether it is okay to register the file.<br />This prevents the mistake of unintentionally using a file that is outside of the project folder.</p>
<p>Select <strong>No</strong> to cancel the file registration.</p>
<p> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955542/124258882.gif" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955542_h2_6">Verifying the File Version</h2>
<p>When you load a file, a warning dialog box is displayed if the version of a project file, sound set file, or bank file is earlier than the current version.<br />This warning dialog box offers three choices: <strong>Upgrade the file to the current version and open</strong>, <strong>Open the file in read-only mode</strong>, or <strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>
<p> <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955542/124258883.gif" class="embedded-image" /></span></p>
<p>If you select to upgrade the file, the earlier versions of SoundMaker can no longer open the file.</p>
