<!-- Analysis Tab -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_758198861">Analysis Tab</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>The <strong>Analysis</strong> tab has two groups of tools to help you quickly analyze a profile: <strong>Story Analysis</strong> and <strong>Spike&nbsp;Detection</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198861_h1_1">Story Analysis Group</h1>
<p>The <strong>Story Analysis</strong> tools help select and order functions to tell an abstract sequential story about what happens over&nbsp;the course of a frame.</p>
<p>To use these tools, you must have taken a <strong>Callstack</strong> profile, you should zoom into a single frame within&nbsp;the <strong>Timeline</strong>, and it helps to only look at a particular core (select a single core from the <strong>Core</strong> drop down in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab&nbsp;toolbar).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_1">Story Analysis Options</h2>
<p>These options help refine the selected functions.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exclude Parents Toggle:&nbsp;</strong>By default, the parents of interesting functions are also selected. This toggle will exclude&nbsp;these parents from the results. This option has no effect on <strong>Top Story Analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exclude Irregular Toggle:&nbsp;</strong>By default, all functions can be included as part of the story. This toggle will exclude&nbsp;functions that do not execute on a regular basis every frame.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Match Heartbeat Toggle:&nbsp;</strong>By default, all functions can be included as part of the story. This toggle will exclude&nbsp;functions that do not appear at an interval similar to the selected frame rate in the <strong>Heartbeats</strong> tab.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_2">Brief Button</h2>
<p>This button selects functions that tell a brief story about what happens over the course of a frame. It is&nbsp;more effective if you first select a single core to look at before&nbsp;hitting this button. Zoom into a single frame in the <strong>Timeline</strong> to see the story.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Brief Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The settings of <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Min</strong>&nbsp;control which functions are selected. If you change&nbsp;these settings, they will not be saved permanently. However, there are three preset setting groups that&nbsp;you can try: <strong>Short</strong>, <strong>Long</strong>, and <strong>Detailed</strong>. These presets offer varying levels of detail in the generated story,&nbsp;going from the most high-level (selects minimal number of key functions) to extremely detailed (selects many&nbsp;functions to show extreme, yet significant, detail).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_3">Top Button</h2>
<p>This button is different from the <strong>Brief</strong> button&nbsp;and implements a slightly different&nbsp;algorithm. This button will select the top functions, exclude particular ones based on settings, then order&nbsp;them chronologically.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Top Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The settings in the <strong>Top</strong> button options will help control what gets selected. The <strong>Max Results</strong> setting is very&nbsp;useful for controlling the number of functions that get selected (however the final results may be lower than&nbsp;this number based on other options that exclude functions). If the results contain many similar functions,&nbsp;you can eliminate similar ones with either the <strong>Exclude Similar Children</strong> or <strong>Exclude Similar Parents</strong>&nbsp;toggle buttons.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198861_h1_2">Spike Detection Group</h1>
<p>The <strong>Spike Detection</strong> tools help quickly find potentially troublesome functions that you should further&nbsp;investigate.&nbsp;These options help refine the selected functions.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Max Results:&nbsp;</strong>This determines how many functions are selected when <strong>Rare</strong>, <strong>Burst</strong>, <strong>Wild</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Flutter</strong>,<strong> Swell</strong>, or <strong>Bad&nbsp;Frame</strong> are clicked. One strategy is to make this number very low (such as 5 or 10) to hyper focus on the&nbsp;worst spiking functions. Another strategy is to make this number very big (such as 100 or 200) and see if&nbsp;anything interesting shows up.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exclude Similar Children:&nbsp;</strong>If this is enabled, child functions that are too similar to their parent will be&nbsp;discarded from the results. This helps to understand which high-level systems are causing the spikes,&nbsp;since parent functions tend to be named after the high-level systems they represent.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exclude Similar Parents:&nbsp;</strong>If this is enabled, parent functions that are too similar to their children will be&nbsp;discarded from the results. This helps to focus on the low level functions that are directly causing the&nbsp;spikes, since these are more likely the leaf functions where the CPU time is actually spent doing work.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_4">Rare Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Rare</strong> button selects functions that rarely spike (which are sampled very infrequently).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Rare Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The default is 10 or fewer spikes over the duration of the profile, but this can be changed with the <strong>Max&nbsp;Spikes</strong> option. The <strong>Min Width</strong> option controls how large a sample run must be (number of consecutive&nbsp;samples) in order to be considered a spike. You can adjust the <strong>Min Width</strong> to make the spike detection&nbsp;more or less sensitive.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_5">Burst Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Burst</strong> button selects functions that have a burst of activity on consecutive frames, but that normally don't execute every single frame.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Burst Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The <strong>Irregularity</strong> option controls the threshold of frame-to-frame irregularity in order for a function to be&nbsp;detected (larger numbers represent more irregularity). The <strong>Min Width</strong> option controls how large a sample&nbsp;run must be (number of consecutive samples) in order to be considered a spike. You can adjust the <strong>Min&nbsp;Width</strong> to make the spike detection more or less sensitive.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_6">Wild Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Wild</strong> button selects functions that vary wildly over their lifetime.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wild Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The first <strong>Min Change</strong> option controls the minimum number of total milliseconds a function must change&nbsp;over the entire profile in order to be detected (reduce this number to make it more sensitive). The second&nbsp;<strong>Min Change</strong> option controls the minimum percentage a function must change over the entire profile in&nbsp;order to be detected (reduce this number to make it more sensitive).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_7">Flutter Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Flutter</strong> button selects functions that are routinely called every frame that have a sudden increase or&nbsp;decrease from one frame to the next.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Flutter Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The Irregularity option controls the threshold of frame-to-frame irregularity in order for a function to be&nbsp;detected (larger numbers represent more irregularity). The first <strong>Min Change</strong> option controls the minimum&nbsp;number of total milliseconds a function must change from frame-to-frame in order to be detected (reduce&nbsp;this number to make it more sensitive). The second <strong>Min Change</strong> option controls the minimum percentage&nbsp;a function must change frame-to-frame in order to be detected (reduce this number to make it more&nbsp;sensitive).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_8">Swell Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Swell</strong> button selects functions that are routinely called every frame, but that gradually increase or&nbsp;decrease over time with a large total difference over the entire profile. For example, a function might take&nbsp;5% on the first frame and then incrementally take more time each frame until by the last frame it takes&nbsp;20%, but the change was gradual with no significant jumps in percentage from one frame to the next.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Swell Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The Irregularity option controls the threshold of frame-to-frame irregularity in order for a function to be&nbsp;detected (larger numbers represent more irregularity). The first <strong>Min Change</strong> option controls the minimum&nbsp;number of total milliseconds a function must change over the entire profile in order to be detected (reduce&nbsp;this number to make it more sensitive). The second <strong>Min Change</strong> option controls the minimum percentage&nbsp;a function must change over the entire profile in order to be detected (reduce this number to make it more&nbsp;sensitive).</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198861_h2_9">Bad Frame Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bad Frame</strong> button selects the slowest frames and then selects functions that performed worse on&nbsp;those frames compared with all other frames.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bad Frame Button Options:&nbsp;</strong>The <strong>Max Frames</strong> option controls how many slow frames it will select for the analysis. The <strong>Use Selected&nbsp;Frames</strong> option will use any user selected frames for the analysis, so you can focus on a particular frame or&nbsp;set of frames that you think are problematic (if no frames are selected, the <strong>Bad Frame</strong> analysis acts as if&nbsp;this option is disabled).</p>
