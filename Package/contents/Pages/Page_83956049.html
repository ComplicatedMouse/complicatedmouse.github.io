<h1 id="Anchor_83956049_h1_1">Animation Sets</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956049_h2_1">Overview</h2>
<p>An animation set is a collection of multiple animations. <br /> An animation set is bound to a model. When played using viewer library, all animations included in an animation set are played simultaneously.</p>
<p>Animation set information is saved in a <a href="../Pages/Page_83955709.html">project file</a>.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>In this section and on 3DEditor menus, <strong>binding</strong> an animation to an animation set refers to the act of including an animation in that animation set.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956049_h3_1">Animation Set Names</h3>
<p>Animation set names must consist of printable ASCII characters.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Names consisting of strings of only tabs or spaces are prohibited.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Animation sets bound to the same model must each have different names.</li>
  <li>Animation sets can have the same name as long as each is bound to different models.</li>
  <li>Animation sets having the same name but bound to different models can be distinguished from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956049_h3_2">Binding Animation Sets</h3>
<p>A single animation set must be bound to a single model.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: The animation set itself may be empty.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>However, you can bind multiple animation sets to the same model.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>When you close a model to which animation sets have been bound, all bound animations are removed.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83956049_h2_2">Using Animation Sets</h2>
<p>Animation sets are manipulated in the File View.</p>
<p>Operations performed in File View can be undone.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_83956049_h3_3">Shortcut Menu</h3>
<p>The following table shows the shortcut menu for animation sets.</p>
