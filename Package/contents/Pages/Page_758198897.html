<div class="text_separate">
<p>The <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Functions</strong> tab displays all of the functions that were sampled during a profile.</p>
<p>To change the measurement units (<strong>Percent</strong>, <strong>Time</strong>, <strong>Avg</strong>, or <strong>Samples</strong>), use the <strong>Unit</strong> buttons in the <strong>Home</strong> tab of the <strong>Ribbon Bar</strong>.</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>These notes point out differences in the&nbsp;<strong>Functions</strong> tab when the <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> experimental feature is enabled. See&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Experimental Features Tab</a> for additional information.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198897_h1_1">Sorting Functions</h1>
<p>Functions can be sorted by <strong>Total</strong>, <strong>Self</strong>, <strong>Diff Total</strong>, <strong>Diff Self</strong>, <strong>Core</strong>, <strong>Thread</strong>, <strong>Module</strong>, <strong>Opcodes</strong>, <strong>Seen&nbsp;In Calls</strong>, <strong>Seen Out Calls</strong>, or <strong>Name</strong> by clicking on each respective heading.</p>
<p>The following columns are optionally shown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Total</strong>: This&nbsp;column is only shown if a <strong>Callstack</strong> profile was taken.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Diff Total</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Diff Self</strong>: These columns appear when clicking the <strong>Diff</strong> toggle button.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Thread</strong>:&nbsp;This column appears when clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Thread</strong>&nbsp;toggle button.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Module</strong>: This column appears when clicking the <strong>Module</strong> toggle button.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Opcodes</strong>, <strong>Seen In Calls</strong>, <strong>Seen Out Calls</strong>: These columns appear when clicking&nbsp;the <strong>Stats</strong> toggle button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each column heading can be clicked to sort by that column.&nbsp;By default, the functions are sorted by <strong>Self</strong>, which is the amount of time spent in each function (not&nbsp;including any sub-functions). Click on the <strong>Total</strong> heading to sort by <strong>Total</strong>, which is the amount of time spent&nbsp;in each function and every function it calls.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198897_h1_2">Selecting Functions</h1>
<p>Click on a function to select it. Click the function again to unselect it. Up to 1000 functions can be selected (each will&nbsp;be highlighted in a different color). Selected functions will be graphed in the <strong>Timeline</strong> and highlighted&nbsp;in the <strong>Call Tree</strong> (the <strong>Call Tree</strong> is only visible if the profile was taken with <strong>Callstack</strong> profile data).</p>
<p>To quickly select the top 50 functions, click on the button marked <strong>Select Top</strong> in the <strong>Functions</strong> toolbar.&nbsp;To quickly deselect all functions, click on the <strong>Deselect All</strong> button in the Functions toolbar.</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>When you click on a function to select it from anywhere in the application, it will take the viewing mode into consideration, and select all of the rows that are appropriate for the mode. These include the&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;rows as well as any&nbsp; <strong>Thread</strong> &nbsp;or&nbsp; <strong>Core</strong> &nbsp;rows underneath the&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;in the hierarchy. For example, when the mode is set to&nbsp;<strong>Functions then Threads</strong>, clicking on the&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;row will select or deselect the&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;row, and all of the&nbsp; <strong>Thread</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp; <strong>Core</strong> &nbsp;rows underneath it in the hierarchy. When the mode is set to&nbsp;<strong>Threads then Functions</strong>, clicking on a&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;row will select the&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;row, and all of the&nbsp; <strong>Core</strong> &nbsp;rows underneath it in the hierarchy. Clicking on a&nbsp; <strong>Thread</strong> &nbsp;row will select all of the&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;rows beneath it, as well as all of the&nbsp; <strong>Core</strong> &nbsp;rows. (Note that the 1,000 selections limit still applies to the individual rows.)</p>
    <p>Selected functions are maintained when the viewing mode changes, although the number of selected rows may increase due to the need to select every row below each selected&nbsp; <strong>Function</strong> &nbsp;row to maintain consistency.</p>
    <p>When the&nbsp;<strong>Select Top</strong> &nbsp;button is clicked, the top 50 functions, from across all groupings will be selected, according to the sort criteria. When the view mode is&nbsp; <strong>Functions Then Threads</strong>, this will have the effect of picking the top 50 functions in the list, based on the function totals, and not differentiating by core or thread. This means that although 50 functions will be selected, more then 50 rows in the list can be selected.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_1">Alternative Selection Methods</h2>
<p>Multiple items can be selected or deselected with <strong>Shift+Click</strong> (select/deselect an item without holding the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong> key, then hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key and click on a second item). The range between the two clicks will be&nbsp;either selected or deselected.</p>
<p>To quickly select only a single item and deselect everything else, <strong>Alt+Click</strong> can be used. This action deselects all&nbsp;and then selects the clicked upon item.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198897_h1_3">Right Click Context Menu</h1>
<p>A right-click in the tab will bring up a context menu containing a variety of options.</p>
<p>
  <strong>View From Here</strong>
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This menu item is only available when Thread-Centric Data Views are enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Selecting this item will change the viewing mode, and bring the selected row into view with a temporary highlight. For example, if you right-click on a <strong>Thread</strong> row and select<strong>View from Here</strong>, the viewing mode will change to <strong>Threads then Functions</strong>. The <strong>Thread</strong> row corresponding to the thread that you right-clicked on will be scrolled into view and highlighted.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Copy Function Name to Clipboard</strong>
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This menu item is labeled <strong>Copy Name to Clipboard</strong>, and will copy the thread name if a <strong>Thread</strong> row is highlighted.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Copies the full function name with arguments to the clipboard.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Deselect All Other Functions</strong>
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This menu item is labeled <strong>Deselect All Others</strong>.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Forces all functions other than the one clicked on to become&nbsp;deselected. This will not result in an unselected function becoming selected.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Show Assembly</strong>
</p>
<p>Moves focus to the <strong>Assembly Tab</strong>, showing the assembly of the clicked&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Show Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Opens a new <strong>Function Details</strong> window, showing the details of the clicked&nbsp;function.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_2">Classification Overrides</h2>
<p>For each sampled function, the profiler automatically detects the system (like Graphics, Physics, Animation, etc.) that it belongs to. To override the automatically detected system classification of any function, right-click the function in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab and choose an <strong>Override Classification</strong> item.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Override Classification:</strong> Shows the current system classification state of the clicked function. Click on any of the shown system names to reclassify the function. After you make a choice, the function will be immediately reclassified in all views. Note: To reset a classification to the default, choose&nbsp;<strong>Auto-Detect</strong>.</p>
<p>
  <strong> Rerun Classifications:&nbsp;</strong>Redetects the classifications of every sampled function. You may want to click this option after specifying several classification overrides. Your overrides helps the auto-detection infer the system classification of related functions.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Clear All Overridden Classifications:&nbsp;</strong>Resets all classifications back to auto-detect. Because classification overrides are applied across all profiles, this will clear all user-specified classification overrides across all profiles. An additional confirmation is required before continuing with this action.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198897_h1_4">Functions Tab Toolbar</h1>
<p>The following controls are in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab toolbar.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_3">Function Grouping Mode Drop Down</h2>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This option is only available when <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> are enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>This drop down list displays and controls the function grouping mode. Note that it will also control the function grouping mode of the on the <a href="../Pages/Page_758198978.html">Call Tree Tab</a>. A description of each mode can be found on the page&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_962042331.html">Experimental Features Tab</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_4">Hierarchy Buttons</h2>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>These buttons are only available when <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> are enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The buttons listed below control the expanded state of the items in the list.</p>
<h6 id="Anchor_758198897_h6_1">Expand All Button</h6>
<p>The&nbsp; <strong>Expand All</strong> &nbsp;button will expand all rows.</p>
<h6 id="Anchor_758198897_h6_2">Collapse All Button</h6>
<p>The&nbsp; <strong>Collapse All</strong> &nbsp;button will collapse all rows.</p>
<h6 id="Anchor_758198897_h6_3">Expand Selected Only Button</h6>
<p>The&nbsp; <strong>Expand Selected Only</strong> &nbsp;button will expand all rows necessary to display all of the selected rows and collapse all other rows.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_5">Core Drop Down Filter and Core Column Heading</h2>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>This option is not available when <strong>Thread-Centric Data Views</strong> are enabled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Click on the <strong>Cores</strong> drop-down in the toolbar to select between <strong>All Cores</strong> and each individual core. Only cores that were profiled will be&nbsp;available in the <strong>Cores</strong> drop-down. The default selection is <strong>All Cores</strong> and each new profile taken or loaded&nbsp;will reset the <strong>Cores</strong> drop-down selection to <strong>All Cores</strong>.</p>
<p>When a particular core is selected, such as <strong>Core 1</strong>, the <strong>Core</strong> column will be hidden since all functions&nbsp;shown belong to the same core. This can be helpful when focusing on a particular core and can help&nbsp;optimize horizontal space in the tab.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_6">Thread Column Heading and&nbsp;Thread Drop Down Filter</h2>
<p>By default, the <strong>Thread</strong> column is hidden (to conserve horizontal space). However, if you want to see which&nbsp;thread a function belongs to, click the <strong>Thread</strong>&nbsp;toggle button in the toolbar. Click the button again to hide the&nbsp;column.</p>
<p>If you want to only view functions belonging to a particular thread, use the <strong>Thread</strong> drop-down to select a particular thread. When an individual thread is selected, the <strong>Thread</strong> column will be hidden since&nbsp;all shown functions belong to the same thread. The default selection is <strong>All Threads</strong> and each new profile&nbsp;taken or loaded will reset the <strong>Thread</strong> drop-down selection to <strong>All Threads</strong>.</p>
<p>By default, threads are named with a 32-bit identifier (such as 0x1052D298). If the profiler is aware of&nbsp;a name for the thread, that name will be displayed in the drop-down. However, the <strong>Thread</strong> column will&nbsp;always only use the 32-bit identifier.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_7">System Classification Drop Down Filter</h2>
<p>If you want to only view functions belonging to a particular system (like Graphics, Physics, Animation, etc.),&nbsp;use the <strong>System Classification</strong> drop-down to select a particular system. The default selection&nbsp;is <strong>All Systems</strong> and each new profile taken or loaded will reset the <strong>System Classification</strong> drop-down&nbsp;selection to <strong>All Systems</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_8">Deselect All Button</h2>
<p>To quickly deselect all selected items, click on the <strong>Deselect All</strong> button.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_9">Select Top Button</h2>
<p>To quickly select the top 50 functions, click on the button marked <strong>Select Top</strong> in the <strong>Functions</strong> toolbar.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_10">Diff Toggle Button and Diff Total / Diff Self Column Headings</h2>
<p>By default, the <strong>Diff Total</strong> and <strong>Diff Self</strong> columns are hidden (to conserve horizontal space), but can be&nbsp;enabled by clicking on the <strong>Diff</strong> button in the <strong>Functions</strong> toolbar. Click the button again to hide the columns.&nbsp;The <strong>Diff Total</strong> and <strong>Diff Self</strong> columns compare the current profile with the last loaded profile, showing a&nbsp;percent difference for each function. For example, if a particular function's <strong>Self</strong> percentage is 10% in the&nbsp;last loaded profile and 12% in the current profile, then a value of +2% will be shown in the <strong>Diff Self</strong> column.&nbsp;Likewise, if a particular function's <strong>Self</strong> percentage is 10% in the last loaded profile and 8% in the current&nbsp;profile, then a value of -2% will be shown in the <strong>Diff Self</strong> column.</p>
<p>To see how your game's performance has changed over time, you can first load a profile taken a while ago&nbsp;(i.e. yesterday, a week ago, a month ago), and then take a current profile. Within the <strong>Diff Tota</strong>l and <strong>Diff&nbsp;Self</strong> columns it will show how much each function has increased or decreased as a percentage. However,&nbsp;be aware that if a particular function was optimized to take less time (and its percentage decreased),&nbsp;percentage-wise it will cause all other functions to increase (even if the absolute amount of time they&nbsp;took was the same between both profiles).</p>
<p>To sort all functions by the absolute value of the percentage&nbsp;difference, click on either the <strong>Diff Total</strong> or <strong>Diff Self</strong> column headers. The sorting is based on absolute&nbsp;value in order to prioritize functions that had the largest percentage change, whether that change was&nbsp;positive or negative.</p>
<p>Note: The <strong>Diff Total</strong> column is only available on callstack profiles.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_11">Module Toggle Button and Modules Column Heading</h2>
<p>By default, the <strong>Module</strong> column is hidden (to conserve horizontal space), but can be enabled by clicking on&nbsp;the <strong>Module</strong> button in the <strong>Functions</strong> toolbar. Click the button again to hide the column.&nbsp;The <strong>Module</strong> column contains the name of the module that each function came from. To sort all functions&nbsp;by the module they came from (alphabetical sort), click on the <strong>Module</strong> column header.</p>
<p>Note: The <strong>Module</strong> column is only useful if there were relocatable modules used in the application.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_12">Opcodes Column Heading</h2>
<p>By default, the <strong>Opcodes</strong> column is hidden (to conserve horizontal space), but can be enabled by clicking&nbsp;on the <strong>Stats</strong> toggle&nbsp;button in the <strong>Functions</strong> toolbar. Click the button again to hide the column.</p>
<p>This column shows how many assembly opcodes are in each function (the size of the function). To sort all&nbsp;functions by the number of assembly opcodes (most to least), click on the <strong>Opcodes</strong> column header.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_13">Seen In Calls and Seen Out Calls Column Headings</h2>
<p>By default, the <strong>Seen In Calls</strong> and <strong>Seen Out Calls</strong> columns are hidden (to conserve horizontal space), but&nbsp;can be enabled by clicking on the <strong>Stats</strong> toggle button in the <strong>Functions</strong> toolbar. Click the button again to hide the&nbsp;column.</p>
<p>This column shows the number of in or out calls seen during the profile compared with the number of&nbsp;possible in or out calls detected through static and runtime analysis. For example, if a given function was&nbsp;seen to be called from 6 different functions during profiling, yet through analysis it was determined that it&nbsp;could have been called from 30 different functions, then the value &quot;6/30&quot; would appear in the <strong>Seen In Calls</strong>&nbsp;column for that function. To sort all functions by the number of possible in or out calls (the denominator of&nbsp;the reported value), click on the <strong>Seen In Calls</strong> or <strong>Seen Out Calls</strong> column header. If you are interested in&nbsp;viewing the function names for the seen in and out calls, select the function and click on the <strong>Call Tree</strong> tab&nbsp;to further inspect the call flow. If you are interested in viewing the function names of all possible in or out&nbsp;calls, then right-click on the function name in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab and select <strong>Show Details</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_14">Args Toggle Button</h2>
<p>By default, function names don't include their argument list when seen in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab and <strong>Call&nbsp;Tree</strong> tab (in order to make the list more readable and speed up GUI drawing time). If you wish to show the&nbsp;function arguments, click the <strong>Args</strong> toggle button.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_15">Copy Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Copy</strong> button will copy to the clipboard whatever is currently shown using the current sorting and&nbsp;filtering. You can then paste the content into an email, document, or Excel spreadsheet. Because the&nbsp;copied content uses tab delimiters, it will retain the column organization when pasted into an Excel&nbsp;spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The <strong>Copy</strong> button takes into account what is currently selected. If any items are selected at the time&nbsp;the <strong>Copy</strong> button is pressed, then only the selected items will be copied. If nothing is currently selected,&nbsp;everything will be copied.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_16">Selected Only Toggle Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Selected Only</strong> button forces the list display to only show items which are currently selected. If this&nbsp;mode is enabled and a function is deselected, it will be removed from the displayed list.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_758198897_h1_5">Filtering Functions</h1>
<p>Functions can be filtered using the <strong>Filter</strong> text box at the bottom of the <strong>Functions</strong> tab. This allows you to&nbsp;find a particular function or allow you to look at a class of functions or a certain namespace (such as&nbsp;nn).</p>
<p>Type any string into the text box and a search is performed for the items that contain the&nbsp;string. Only items matching the search text will be displayed. To negate the results (show everything that&nbsp;does not match the filter), click on the <strong>Negate</strong> (&quot;<strong>!</strong>&quot;) toggle button to the right of the text box. To enable case sensitive searches, click on the <strong>Match Case</strong> (&quot;<strong>Aa</strong>&quot;) toggle button.&nbsp;If there are no&nbsp;matches for the search, the text box will be highlighted orange.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are also supported (using .NET RegEx, which is Perl 5 compatible).&nbsp;To enable regular expression searches, click on the <strong>Regular Expression</strong> (&quot;<strong>.*</strong>&quot;) toggle button to the right of the text box.</p>
<p>When filtering functions, the standard filter only checks against the function name; no arguments are included in the search. This eliminates results where a match occurs in the function arguments, since showing&nbsp;matches to function arguments is typically not desirable and results in unwanted matches. To include function arguments in the search, use the <strong>Regular Expression</strong> (&quot;<strong>.*</strong>&quot;) toggle button.</p>
<p>All filters in the <strong>Functions</strong>, <strong>Last</strong>, <strong>Threads</strong>, <strong>Counters</strong>, <strong>Instrumented</strong>, <strong>Gfx Groups</strong>, <strong>Shaders</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Call Tree</strong>, and <strong>Code Coverage</strong> tabs act similarly.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_17">Clearing the Filter</h2>
<p>When text has been entered into the <strong>Filter</strong> text box, the <strong>Clear</strong> (&quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;) button appears. Clicking on the button will clear the text from the <strong>Filter</strong> text box, but does not change the toggle buttons that are selected. While typing in the <strong>Filter</strong> text box, you can also press the Escape key to quickly clear the text.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_18">Negate &quot;!&quot; Button</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Negate</strong>&nbsp;(&quot;<strong>!</strong>&quot;) button controls how the filter text box is interpreted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Negate selected:</strong>&nbsp;The search results are negated. All items that do not match the filter text box are shown.</li>
  <li>
    <strong> Negate unselected:</strong>&nbsp;The search results are not modified.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_19">Match Case &quot;Aa&quot; Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Match Case</strong> (&quot;<strong>Aa</strong>&quot;) button controls how the filter text box is interpreted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Match Case selected</strong>: Searches are case-sensitive. For example, a search for &quot;foo&quot; will not match &quot;Foo&quot;.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Match Case unselected</strong>: Searches are case-insensitive. For example, a search for &quot;foo&quot; will match &quot;Foo&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_20">Regular Expression &quot;.*&quot; Button</h2>
<p>The <strong>Regular Expression</strong>&nbsp;button controls how the filter text box is interpreted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Regular Expression selected:</strong> The filter text box is treated as a regular expression.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Regular Expression unselected:</strong> The filter text box is not treated as a regular expression.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Before the <strong>Match Case</strong> option was added, regular expressions defaulted to case-sensitive searching. They now use the <strong>Match Case</strong> option.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_758198897_h2_21">Saved Filters</h2>
<p>Saved filters allow for using the same filters between profiling sessions, with any saved filters being loaded&nbsp;when the profiler is opened.</p>
<p>Filters are automatically saved when either the focus leaves the text entry or the Enter key is pressed. The five most recent entries are saved and can be reselected by using the drop-down. When selecting a previously saved filter, any toggle button options that were selected at the time of the search are also reapplied.</p>
<p>Saved filters are shared between tabs depending on the general contents of the tab.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Function filters: <strong>Function</strong>, <strong>Last</strong>, <strong>Instrumented</strong>, <strong>Call Tree</strong>, and <strong>Code Coverage</strong> tabs.</li>
  <li>Thread filters: <strong>Threads</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Counter filers: <strong>Counters</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Graphics filters: <strong>Gfx Groups</strong> and <strong>Shaders</strong> tabs.</li>
