<!-- When EDEV Initialization Fails -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_159244488">When EDEV Initialization Fails</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>Factors such as the EDEV status can cause initialization to fail.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initialization fails.</li>
  <li>The EDEV console you want to initialize does not appear (or it no longer appears) on the EDEV connection list in InitializeEdevWin.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this happens, verify the following.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_1">Using InitializeEdev.exe (or InitializeEdevWin.exe)</h1>
<p>We recommend directly calling <code>InitializeEdev.exe</code> or <code>InitializeEdevWin.exe</code>.</p>
<p>The following files also call these functions directly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\InitializeEdev.bat</li>
  <li>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\Tools\CommandLineTools\DevKitSetup.bat</li>
  <li>%NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT\Tools\CommandLineTools\DevKitSetup.ps1</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_2">Verifying the Specified Parameters</h1>
<p>If you are using the <code>InitializeEdev.exe</code> command-line tool, verify that the specified parameters match. (The serial number works with or without a check digit.)</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_3">(When Downgrading the Version) Verifying Whether the Version Has Restrictions</h1>
<p>When using <code>InitializeEdev.exe</code> included with an earlier SDK version to initialize an EDEV that was initialized with <code>InitializeEdev.exe</code> included with a new SDK version, in some cases depending on the version, initialization may fail or safe mode must be entered manually.</p>
<p>The following earlier versions have these constraints.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Versions 2.2.0-0 and 2.2.0-1 of the firmware</li>
  <li>All versions earlier than NX Add-On 1.5.0 (with firmware version 2.1.0-0)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_4">Repeating Initialization</h1>
<p>Sometimes initializing the EDEV several times is successful. Try reattempting initialization.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_5">Fully Charging the EDEV Console</h1>
<p>Try initialization after fully charging the EDEV console.</p>
<p>To charge the device you must attach the AC adapter. You cannot charge simply by connecting the device to a PC with a USB cable.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_6">Reconnecting the USB Cable and Turning On the Power</h1>
<p>Try initializing the EDEV console again after reconnecting the USB cable and turning the power on.</p>
<p>If initialization is particularly unsuccessful, reconnect the USB cable with the following procedure.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the USB cable from the EDEV system.</li>
  <li>Hold down (for approximately 12 seconds) the POWER Button on the upper left of the EDEV console to turn off the power.</li>
  <li>Connect the USB cable to the EDEV console while the power is off.</li>
  <li>After the console is connected, it automatically turns on. Try initialization again.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the device connected to a relay box, try connecting it directly to the PC without using the relay box.<br /></p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_7">Exiting Target Manager if It Is Running</h1>
<p>Exit the Target Manager if it is running, and then try to initialize EDEV.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Target Manager stays in the system tray, so also check there.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_8">Verifying That the EDEV Console Is Recognized by the Device Manager</h1>
<p>Verify that the EDEV is recognized as a USB device in Device Manager.<br />For more information, see the EDEV Drivers section of <a href="../Pages/Page_126561209.html">Initializing the EDEV</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_9">Manually Activating Safe Mode</h1>
<p>Sometimes initialization is successful after activating safe mode.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Safe mode is a mode that runs with minimum features.</p>
    <p>Use safe mode in the following situations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The console is not operating properly and must be restored.</li>
      <li>EDEV initialization fails.</li>
      <li>The power is on but the system menu does not appear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Safe mode can be activated with user operations.</p>
    <p>After safe mode is activated, you may not be able to start in normal mode until the EDEV is initialized, so <strong><u>we recommend using safe mode only when you must restore or initialize</u>. </strong></p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_159244488_h2_1">Procedures for Entering Safe Mode</h2>
<p>There are two ways to enter safe mode.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_159244488_h3_1">[Method 1] With Joy-Con (R) Attached</h3>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_159244488/263110059.png" height="150" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <u>We recommend this method.</u>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button (<em><u>for approximately 12 seconds</u></em>) and turn off the EDEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system will restart after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)</li>
  <li>Attach the right Joy-Con to the EDEV console. (Do not attach the left Joy-Con.)</li>
  <li>Press the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.</li>
  <li>To check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, restart the process from step 1.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Anchor_159244488_h3_2">[Method 2] Without Joy-Con Attached</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Hold down the POWER Button (<em><u>for approximately 12 seconds</u></em>) and turn off the EDEV console with the USB cable connected. (The system will restart after the button is held down for 20 seconds, so do not go much longer than 12 seconds.)</li>
  <li>Press the buttons on the upper left of the console in the following order.<br /><ol><li>Press the POWER Button while holding down the volume down button.</li><li>While holding down the POWER Button, release the volume down button and press the volume up button.</li><li>While holding down the volume up button, release the POWER Button.</li><li>Release the volume up button.</li></ol></li>
  <li>To check whether safe mode is running, see Method for Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode. If the system did not enter safe mode correctly, restart the process from step 1.</li>
</ol>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>For cases where the system enters the standard startup sequence and displays the menu despite attempting to enter safe mode, sometimes adjusting the intervals between button operations will fix the issue. (This is because some operations may not be detected if the intervals between button operations is too fast.)</p>
    <p>Use &quot;every 0.6 second&quot; as a guide for the intervals. It is equivalent to &quot;4 beat intervals at 100 BPM.&quot; If you search for a video with &quot;BPM=100,&quot; you should be able to find a video that you can use as a guide.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_159244488_h2_2">Verifying Whether the System Has Entered Safe Mode</h2>
<p>Depending on the firmware version, there are various methods for verifying whether the system has entered safe mode.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Press the Re-Scan button to display the systems that are in safe mode &quot;(Safe Mode)&quot; in the list of connected systems. (However, only do this when using <code>InitializeEdevWin.exe</code>.)</li>
  <li>&quot;NX DevKit Safe Mode&quot; is displayed for four seconds on the EDEV console screen. (However, this happens only when using an EDEV initialized from NX Add-On 3.0.0 and later.)</li>
  <li>The EDEV console screen remains dark. (However, this happens only when using an EDEV initialized with NX Add-On 1.X or earlier.)<ol><li>This screen may momentarily light up white.</li></ol></li>
</ol>
<p>When using an EDEV console initialized prior to NX Add-On 1.0, the following &quot;screen may turn red during safe mode operations&quot; situation may occur.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>Depending on the SDK version, there are cases where InitializeEdev is not detected even when entering safe mode manually.<br />The fix for this issue was implemented in the following SDK versions, so we recommend using these versions to run safe mode.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>NX Add-On 0.12x series versions 0.12.17 and later (firmware versions 1.0.0-21 and later)</li>
      <li>NX Add-On 1.x series versions 1.4.0 and later (firmware versions 2.0.0-16 and later)</li>
      <li>NX Add-On 3.0.0 SS1 and later</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>When using an EDEV console that has not been initialized after NX Add-On 1.0, performing the operations to enter safe mode may cause the screen to turn red. If this state occurs, hold down the POWER Button for 12 seconds, and then press the POWER Button again to start safe mode.</p>

  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>To enter safe mode on an EDEV console with NX Add-On 0.10.0 or earlier (the firmware displayed in the DevMenu will be 0.7.0-2 or earlier), it must be the only EDEV console connected to the PC.</p>
    <p>If any other EDEV consoles are connected to the PC, remove them.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_10">Using USB 2.0 When USB 3.0 Connection Fails</h1>
<p>EDEV setup may fail depending on the compatibility with the USB 3.0 controller.<br />Try the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update the USB 3.0 controller driver to the latest version.</li>
  <li>Update the USB 3.0 controller firmware to the latest version (sometimes this is not publicly available).</li>
  <li>Perform setup by connecting the EDEV to a USB 2.0 port.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setup has been confirmed to fail when using a PC with the following USB 3.0 controller.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_11">Reducing the Number of EDEV Connected to the PC to One</h1>
<p>EDEV consoles initialized with NX Add-On 0.10.0 or earlier (the firmware displayed in the DevMenu will be 0.7.0-2 or earlier) may fail if other EDEV consoles are connected to the PC.<br />If this occurs, remove all but one of the EDEV consoles, restart the remaining console, and then reinitialize it.</p>
<p>(Note that this step is unnecessary with systems initialized with firmware later than NX Add-On 0.10.0.)</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_159244488_h1_12">Contacting Support</h1>
<p>If initialization is unsuccessful after attempting these procedures, contact Nintendo support.</p>
<p>When contacting support, <em><u>the process will be smoother if you include the following information.</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Serial number of the EDEV unit</li>
  <li>SDK version</li>
  <li>Initialization log<ul><li>For InitializeEdevWin, copy the log that is output to the log window to a text file and send in the text file.</li><li>For InitializeEdev, execute a log with the <code>--verbose</code> option added and save it to a file.</li></ul></li>
