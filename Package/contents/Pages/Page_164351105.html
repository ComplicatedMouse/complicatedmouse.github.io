<h1 id="Anchor_164351105_h1_1">What Is a Layout?</h1>
<p>A <em>layout</em>, then, is the resulting arrangement of panes (described in the next section) on the XY plane.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_164351105_h1_2">Panes</h1>
<p>The basic element of Layout layouts is the <em>pane</em>. Panes consist of one or more rectangular polygons. A <em>layout</em>, then, is the resulting arrangement of panes on the XY plane.</p>
<p>Panes are organized in a hierarchical parent-child structure called the <em>pane tree</em>.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">

  </span>
</p>
<p>NW4F Layout maintains parameters such as <strong>position</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, <strong>rotation</strong>, and <strong>transparency</strong> for each pane.<br />The values for these parameters are also inherited by child panes.<br />For example, moving a parent pane also moves any associated child panes.<br />This allows you to move and scale complicated pane objects consisting of several images at the same time.</p>
<p>There are six types of panes.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_164351105_h2_1">Picture Panes</h2>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080061.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Picture panes are for displaying simple image data.<br />In most cases, each picture pane has a single image. However, you can add or subtract multiple images, combining them in a single picture pane by using the <strong>multi-texture feature</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_164351105_h2_2">Text Box Panes</h2>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080060.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Text box panes <strong>are for displaying text</strong>.<br />You can display the text in almost any font by using the FontConverter tool to convert and use fonts installed on your PC.<br />Each character is rendered inside its own rectangular polygon, but these polygons automatically inherit the position and scale of the text box pane in which they reside.</p>
<p>Text box panes support a variety of features for customizing the appearance of text, such as centering or aligning text, italics, and shadows.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_164351105_h2_3">Window Panes</h2>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080057.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Window panes are similar to picture panes but different in that they consist of <strong>multiple images: one for the outline of the pane and one used inside the pane</strong>.<br />Changing the size of a window pane leaves the size of the outline images unchanged but scales the size of the inner image accordingly.<br />Window panes are well-suited when <strong>you want to be able to change the size of an image without the pane outline showing any scaling artifacts</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_164351105_h2_4">Null Pane</h2>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080056.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>As the name suggests, null panes are <strong>panes that are not used to display anything</strong>.<br />Null panes have a variety of uses. For example, you can create a null pane and then create several child panes to the null pane so that you can move the child panes at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_164351105_h2_5">Boundary Panes</h2>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080058.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Boundary panes are similar to null panes in that they are not used for displaying anything. <strong>When selected or tapped, however, boundary panes display the selected region</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_164351105_h2_6">Parts Pane</h2>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/83080052.png" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Parts panes are a special type of pane that work slightly differently from all the other types of panes. Parts panes effectively function as sub-layouts. <strong>Using parts panes allows you to place a whole layout with all its constituent panes inside an entirely different layout</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the parts pane in the preceding image is itself a layout comprising of a window pane, a text box pane, a null pane, and a boundary pane.</p>
<p>The parts in a parts pane can be configured to act as buttons using the <strong>controls</strong> feature.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_164351105_h1_3">Groups</h1>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/240720891.png" width="500" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Groups are used for <strong>grouping several panes together</strong>.<br />To create a group, select several panes that you want in the group and then right-click and select <strong>Create Group</strong> from the shortcut menu.<br />Groups are used primarily for specifying the panes you want to animate when configuring animations.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_164351105_h1_4">Animations</h1>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_83955988/240720901.png" width="500" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>Each of the parameters maintained for panes can be animated.<br />To apply an animation to one of these parameters, use the Curve Editor window as shown in the lower-left corner of the screenshot.</p>
<p>The black points on the curve in the Curve Editor window are called <strong>keys</strong>. Keys represent <strong>the value that an animation parameter has at a particular time in the animation</strong>.<br />How you define units of time depends on how your game is implemented, but typically each unit of time corresponds to one game frame. In a game that runs at 60 fps, each unit of time is equal to 1/60 of a second, and similarly, in a game that runs at 30 fps, each unit of time is equal to 1/30 of a second.</p>
<p>The preceding image, for example, shows a key at time 0 where the X scale is set to 1.0 and a key at time 2 where the X scale is set to 1.1. This key configuration changes the scale of the <strong>N_NormalBtn_00</strong> null pane from 1.0 to 1.1 over the period of time from time 0 to time 2.</p>
<p>In the sample layout, <strong>N_NormalBtn_00</strong> is the name for the child pane of a null pane. The hierarchy places panes called <strong>W_Base_00</strong> and <strong>T_TextShoot_00</strong>. Animating the scale of the parent pane also causes child panes to increase in size.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_164351105_h1_5">Animation Segment Tags</h1>
<p>Animation curves that are applied to a pane can be segmented and named using <strong>animation segment tags</strong>.</p>
<p>In the preceding image, for example, the string <strong>OnOff</strong> is specified as an animation tag for the period of time from time 0 to time 2. It registers an animation tag named <strong>OnOff</strong> that corresponds to the animation that occurs during the corresponding period of time (increasing the scale from 1.0 to 1.1).</p>
<p>After an animation tag is created, you can use the <strong>Specify Related Groups</strong> feature to select other panes to apply that animation to them. <strong>Always make sure to specify the related groups.</strong> If you do not specify any related groups, the animation is applied to all panes in the layout.</p>
<p>In the application source code, you can specify an animation tag name using the <code>CreateGroupAnimatorAuto</code> member function in the <code>Layout</code> class to create an instance of the <code>Animator</code> class for managing and playing animations.</p>
