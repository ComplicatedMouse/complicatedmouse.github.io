    <p>When models or material animations are opened, the system searches for the referenced texture files.<br />If the texture file first found by the search is not opened, the texture file is opened.</p>

<p> When you specify an additional reference path as part of a search, the search range includes 2 and 3. 3DEditor searches 1, 4, and 5 automatically. The reference source files are the files opened in 3DEditor.<br /> Wildcards (*, ?) can be specified in additional reference paths.<br /> When subfolders are searched or a wildcard is specified, and multiple files have the same name, the paths are sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive) and the first file in the sorted list is applied.<br /> If a material reference is also set for the parent material, the first file found in the search range by recursively traversing the parent material is applied.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83955519_h3_2">Setting Multiple Additional Reference Paths</h3>
<p>If more than one additional reference path has been set, the search is carried out in the order they were set.<br />You can set whether to include the subfolders in the folder specified in the additional reference path separately for each additional reference path.</p>

    <p>Specify a directory path for the additional reference path.<br />You can set an absolute path or a relative path from the reference source file.<br />Path strings may include environment variables surrounded by percent signs (%). 3DEditor interprets such paths by replacing any environment variables surrounded by percent signs (%) with the value the environment variable represents.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_83955519_h3_3">Specifying Absolute Paths in the Settings File</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you set an additional reference path name.</li>
  <li>Additional reference path names are enabled only for additional reference paths set using an absolute path.</li>
  <li>Each additional reference path name must be unique.</li>

<p>You can specify additional reference paths for intermediate files either with the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956043.html">assign utility</a>, or in 3DEditor on the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955586.html">Additional Reference Path page in the property window</a>.</p>
<p>When specifying additional reference paths for intermediate files as absolute paths, specify the path starting from the appropriate environment variable, which is enclosed in percent signs (%).</p>
