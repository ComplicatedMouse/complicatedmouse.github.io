<h2 id="Anchor_1148422536_h2_1">Added a feature for specifying the rounding direction for sequence sound ticks.</h2>
<p>Added a feature to SoundMaker's sound archive settings for specifying the rounding direction for sequence sound ticks.<br />As part of this change, older SoundMaker project (FSPJ) files must be automatically updated when loaded.</p>
<p>Set the tick rounding direction for sequence sounds to either the new playback method, rounding up, or the playback method compatible with Nintendo SDK 13.0.0 and earlier, rounding down.<br />New FSPJ files created with this version or a later version of SoundMaker are set to rounding up by default, creating a different waveform output when playing back a sequence sound.<br />When FSPJ files are updated using this or later version of SoundMaker or SoundProjectUtility, or files are imported using the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955597.html">Importing External Files</a> feature, they are imported as rounding down by default, maintaining compatibility of the waveform output results during sequence sound playback.</p>
<p>The following description explains the changes in behavior due to the difference in the rounding direction of sequence sound ticks.</p>
<p>If a sequence sound tick falls between audio frames (which delimit the minimum intervals of time in which the <code>atk</code> library can control volume and sound production), this feature defines whether to process the sequence commands included in that tick in the former audio frame or the latter audio frame.<br />The relationship between sequence sounds and audio frames is as follows.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_1148422536/1148422451.png" width="615" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>In NintendoSDK 13.0.0 or earlier, if sequence sound ticks are between audio frames, the tick is rounded forward in time to process the sequence command.<br />The rounding process for this tick is rounding down, as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_1148422536/1148422516.png" width="615" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>With the rounding down method, when playback is cued from the sample position as calculated from tick, a sound that is supposed to play might possibly be treated as already played.<br />For this reason, a newly prepared method for processing sequence commands rounds the sequence sound tick backward in time.<br />This tick rounding process is rounding up, as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p>
  <span class="embedded-file-wrapper ">
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_1148422536/1148422553.png" width="615" class="embedded-image" />
  </span>
</p>
<p>With rounding up, the opposite of what happens with rounding down may happen. When playback is cued from the sample position as calculated from tick, the end of a sound that was supposed to have finished being played might possibly be included in the start of the part that has been cued.</p>
<p>This change has a large scope of impact, including potential changes to the loop length configured in the sequence sound. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, regardless of the method selected.<br />For this reason, an option has been added to SoundMaker's sound archive settings for specifying the rounding direction for sequence sound ticks.</p>
