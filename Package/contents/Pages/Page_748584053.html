<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_748584053">Glossary</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_1">Buffer</h1>
<p>The memory on the dev kit used to store the profile data.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_2">Call Tree</h1>
<p>A tree constructed from individual sample callstacks, showing the calling structure of the game during the&nbsp;time it was profiled. This is slightly different from a call graph, since there are no cycles. In a call tree, the&nbsp;same function can appear multiple times, based on where it was called.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_3">Callstack</h1>
<p>The list of function calls stored in the application's stack.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_4">Counter</h1>
<p>Data from a CPU counter (performance counters) or user data manually logged through the profiler API.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_5">Heartbeat</h1>
<p>A periodic event on a particular core that can be manually logged (through the profiler API) or inferred automatically by the profiler. A heartbeat is similar to a frame marker, but more generic in meaning since it can represent&nbsp;any type of periodic event. Heartbeat markers can be viewed in the <strong>Timeline</strong>&nbsp;and can be selected in the <strong>Heartbeats</strong> tab of the <strong>Ribbon Bar</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_6">Icicle Graph</h1>
<p>An icicle graph is a hierarchical display of the sampled callstack over time, with the root of the callstack at&nbsp;the top and the leaf function at the bottom.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_7">In-Process</h1>
<p>Refers to operations that happen within a user's application. Most commonly refers to taking a profile from within the user's application. See&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_809639172.html">In-Process and Out-of-Process Profiling Modes</a> for more information on In-Process profiling.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_8">Out-of-Process</h1>
<p>Refers to operations that happen in another process outside of the user's application. Most commonly refers to taking a profile from the profiler process.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_809639172.html">In-Process and Out-of-Process Profiling Modes</a> for more information on Out-of-Process profiling.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_9">Sampling</h1>
<p>Periodically stopping the game and recording the current function or callstack.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_10">Sampling Rate</h1>
<p>The rate at which samples are taken.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_11">Self</h1>
<p>The time spent exclusively in a function, but not any functions it calls (<strong>Self</strong> = <strong>Total</strong> - <strong>Sub</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_12">Sub</h1>
<p>The time spent in the functions called by this function (<strong>Sub</strong> = <strong>Total</strong> - <strong>Self</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_13">Sync</h1>
<p>Connecting with the dev kit and loading the ELF file. Once the profiler is synced, a profile can be taken.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_14">System Classification</h1>
<p>Functions are classified as belonging to a particular game system, such as Animation, Graphics, Physics,&nbsp;and so on.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_15">Total</h1>
<p>The time spent in a function and all of the functions it calls&nbsp;(<strong>Total</strong>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>Self</strong> +&nbsp;<strong>Sub</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_16">Tracing</h1>
<p>Tracing is a type of data recording that happens when an event occurs or is logged periodically (as opposed to statistical sampling). Examples of tracing in the profiler are&nbsp;<strong>Thread State</strong>, <strong>GPU</strong>, <strong>Audio</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong> data recording. Instrumentation is a type of tracing, but the term instrumentation is used exclusively in the profiler to refer to function tracing. Counters, when logged within the code, are another type of tracing that happens in the profiler, but note that <strong>CPU&nbsp;Performance Counters</strong> are periodically sampled along with function sampling.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_17">Units</h1>
<p>The type of measured value used to show how much time a function has taken. This can be either <strong>Percent</strong>, <strong>Time</strong>, <strong>Avg</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Samples</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_748584053_h1_18">Unsync</h1>
<p>Disconnecting from the dev kit.</p>
