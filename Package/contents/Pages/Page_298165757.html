<h1 id="Anchor_298165757_h1_1">Overview</h1>
<p>A multi-application card is an NX card on which multiple applications have been written.</p>
<p>The term &quot;multi-application card&quot; is sometimes abbreviated as &quot;MAC.&quot;</p>
<p>A multi-application card assumes that applications that have passed Lotcheck will be collected together and sold on a single NX card.</p>
<p>This page describes the restrictions on multi-application cards, and the need to upload a multi-application card ROM to the Nintendo Developer Portal (NDP).</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>For the procedure for writing applications to an NX development multi-application card and starting them, see <a href="../Pages/Page_166051528.html">this page</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_298165757_h1_2">Restrictions</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_298165757_h2_1">Number of Applications That Can Be Included on a Multi-Application Card</h2>
<p>Four applications can be included on a multi-application card.</p>
<p>If you want to include five or more applications on a card, contact your Nintendo support representative.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_298165757_h2_2">Updates Cannot Be Distributed for Downloadable Content Included in the Multi-Application Card</h2>
<p>Unlike for the downloadable content purchased on Nintendo eShop, you cannot distribute updated versions of the downloadable content included in a multi-application card.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you want to update the content, you must do so by distributing an application patch.</p>

<p>Use <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html#Anchor_107320233_bundleup">AuthoringTool bundleup</a> to create an NSP file for uploading to NDP.</p>
<p>When creating this NSP file, you need the application ID to set for the multi-application card and the NSP files to be included in the multi-application card.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>Application ID<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>Specify an application ID that can be retrieved when the multi-application card product is created on NDP.</li><li>Use a prototyping ID, such as 0x0100000003488000, when the purpose is behavior verification in development.<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>For more information about application IDs for prototypes, see <a href="../Pages/Page_177636769.html">this page</a>.</li><li>An NSP file for uploading that was created using a prototyping ID cannot be uploaded to NDP.</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<h3 id="Anchor_298165757_h3_1">1: List NSP Files Including Multi-Application Cards in a Text File</h3>
<p>Create a UTF-8 text file with BOM.</p>
<p>Enter the absolute paths, one per line, of the NSP files for the applications, patches, and downloadable content to include in the card.</p>
<p>Applications appear in the HomeMenu and DevMenu in the order that application NSP files are described in the text file.</p>
<p>The order in which the patch and downloadable content NSP files is described does not matter.</p>

  <span style="color: rgb(117,117,117);">Debugging Using NX Development Cards</span>
</h2>
<p>Because the operating frequency differs from the download version when an application is run on an NX development card, the behavior of the application may be affected.</p>
<p>For more information about the relationship between card size and operating frequency, see <a href="../Pages/Page_177655843.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Because multiple applications are included on a single NX development card, the required card size and operating frequency may differ for each application.</p>
<p>The required card size is automatically calculated when an NSP file for uploading is created. However, in cases where you want to specify the card size or operating frequency yourself, such as when the size is expected to change later or you want to specify the operating frequency, you can use the <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a> options to specify the values.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>The capacity and operating frequency for the NX card to be produced, is determined based on the settings for the NSP file for uploading that has been submitted.</p>
<p>Make sure to verify behavior after determining suitable settings.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<p>For the procedure for verifying the behavior of a multi-application card, see <a href="../Pages/Page_166051528.html">this page</a>.</p>

  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>When using NintendoSDK Firmware for NX FW 13.1.0-1.2 or earlier, there is a bug where the <code>gamecard write</code> command of DevMenuCommand fails if the NSP file for a multi-application card includes downloadable content.</p>
    <p>As workaround, during the debug processing using the NX development card, you can use <code>convertaoc</code> in AuthoringTool to specify the NSP file converted to on-card downloadable content and create an NSP file for multi-application cards.<br />When creating an NSP file for submission, use the process described earlier in Creating an NSP File for Uploading. You cannot specify on-card downloadable content.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="Anchor_298165757_h1_4">Submitting</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_298165757_h2_5">NSP File for Submission</h2>
<p>You can submit NSP files for multi-application cards that were created using the processes described earlier in Creating an NSP File for Uploading.</p>
<p>However, note that the NSP files for the application, patch, and downloadable content that you passed to <a href="../Pages/Page_107320233.html">AuthoringTool</a> when this NSP file was created must have already passed Lotcheck.</p>
<p>An error occurs if the multi-application card NSP file you submit was created using NSP files that have not yet passed Lotcheck.</p>
<p>As long as the application, patch, and downloadable content NSP files have passed Lotcheck, using a version of NX Add-On that would have been prohibited for past submissions is now acceptable.<br />In addition, the application or patch must have passed Lotcheck as the packaged version.</p>
