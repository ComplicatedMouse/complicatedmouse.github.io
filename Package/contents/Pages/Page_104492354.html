<p>You can specify the SDEV you want to initialize with the following procedure if it does not appear in the list.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the connection list for a serial number that is not appearing, right-click one of the displayed rows.</li>

<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_3">Cannot add development hardware to Target Manager.</h2>
<p>Before connecting to development hardware, the target must be added (<strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Add Target</strong>).</p>
<p>If the development hardware is not displayed on the <strong>Add Target</strong> screen, check the following items.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the development hardware turned on?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the SDEV devkit, verify the following items.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the SDEV connected to the PC via a LAN cable?</li>
  <li>Is the SDEV on the same subnet as the PC? (Hardware on different subnets cannot be detected.)</li>
  <li>Are the PC firewall settings correct?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the EDEV devkit, verify the following items.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the EDEV connected to the PC via a USB cable?</li>
  <li>Is the EDEV USB device driver installed?<ul><li>Use the Device Manager tool in Windows to check whether the device driver is installed. If the EDEV is connected, NintendoSdkDebugger or NintendoSDK DevKit is displayed in Device Manager.</li><li>To manually install the device driver, run the <code>Installers\DevkitDriver\dpinst.exe</code> file located in the <code>NintendoSDK</code> installation directory.</li><li>You must run the USB driver installation script with administrator privileges. In addition, make sure that you check that execution is not blocked by security software, UAC, or anything else.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_4">Cannot connect to development hardware in Target Manager.</h2>
<p>In some cases, the status does not become <strong>Connected</strong> when selecting <strong>Connect to Target</strong> for a target that has been added.</p>
<p>When that happens, try the following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Delete the entry for the development hardware you want to run using <strong>Delete Target</strong>.</li>
  <li>Add the development hardware you want to run using <strong>Add Target</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Connect to Target</strong> for the development hardware added in step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases, the target added in step 3 is assigned an IP address different from the IP address that the target deleted in step 1.<br />A different IP address may be assigned if <strong>Connect to Target</strong> is selected immediately after the development hardware is connected to an AC adapter. To prevent a different IP address from being assigned, wait about 60 seconds after connecting the AC adapter before selecting <strong>Connect to Target</strong>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to avoid having a different IP address assigned by setting a static IP for the development hardware.<br />For more information, see <a href="../Pages/Page_109318702.html">Setting a Static IP Address for SDEV</a> for the full procedure.</p>

<p>Reset the development hardware.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_6">How do I manually install the EDEV USB device driver?</h2>
<p>In most cases, the EDEV USB driver is installed automatically when you use NDI to install NintendoSDK.</p>
<p>However, if the automatic install fails or the USB device driver gets deleted for some reason, you must install the device driver manually.</p>
<p>To install the device driver manually, run the <code>Installers\DevkitDriver\dpinst.exe</code> file located in the <code>NintendoSDK</code> installation directory.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_7">A dump file is not created when the application crashes.</h2>
<p>If the dump file save location is set to <code>C:\Windows</code> or a similar system directory, and Target Manager is executed without administrator rights, the dump file will not be generated.<br />This bug is caused by Windows imposing file write restrictions on Target Manager.<br />Specify a directory that Target Manager can write to as the save location.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_8">Entering and waking from sleep mode takes time when connected to Target Manager.</h2>
<p>Because the development environment has a different system structure than the retail device, entering and waking from sleep mode tends to take more time than with the retail device.</p>
<p>The time it takes for each transition becomes longer, especially when connected to Target Manager. It may take 10 seconds to wake from sleep mode, but this is not a bug.</p>
<p>This does not occur in <a href="../Pages/Page_186060673.html">Firmware Approximating the Production Hardware (PROD MODE)</a>.</p>

<p>After updating the SDEV to the latest SDK, if you attempt to update to a previously released SDK and the process stops midway, do the following to initialize the SDEV.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the command prompt.</li>
  <li>Configure the environment variables.<br /><ol><li>Set the <code>SDK_NX_LATEST</code> environment variable to the path to the latest SDK.<br />　Example: <code>SET SDK_NX_LATEST=D:\NintendoSDK9</code></li><li>Set the <code>SDK_NX</code> environment variable to the path of the SDK you want to update to.<br />　Example: <code>SET SDK_NX=D:\NintendoSDK3</code></li><li>Set the <code>SDEV</code> environment variable to the IP address of the SDEV.<br />　Example: <code>SET SDEV=192.168.0.10</code></li><li>Execute the following command.<br />　<code>%SDK_NX_LATEST%\Tools\CommandLineTools\UpdateHostBridge.exe update --force --image %SDK_NX%\Resources\Firmwares\NX\HostBridgeFirmware.nhf --target %SDEV%</code></li></ol></li>
  <li>After the command from in 2d is complete, wait approximately 30 seconds while the SDEV restarts.</li>
  <li>Initialize with <code>InitializeSdev</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the SDEV screen remains black and nothing is displayed even after waiting for several minutes, see <a href="https://developer.nintendo.com/html/online-docs/g1kr9vj6-ja/Packages/Docs/Manuals/NintendoSwitch-SDEV_Usage_Manual-ja/contents/Pages/Page_209858045.html">Initializing the Connection Settings Between the SDEV and PC</a>.</p>

<p>VSI may not have been installed correctly.</p>
<p>To check whether the correct version of Visual Studio Integration for NX is installed, select <strong>VS</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Extensions and Updates</strong>.</p>
<p>If it is not installed, reinstall VSI from NDI.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_12">When a previous version of Visual Studio is installed, I cannot build a project from MSBuild.</h2>
<p>If an earlier version of Visual Studio is installed, and it is Visual Studio 2010 or later, <code>MSBuild</code> attempts to build projects using that version of Visual Studio.</p>
<p>However, you can only build NintendoSDK projects in the supported versions of Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2013, and Visual Studio 2015 in NX Add-On 0.5.0).</p>
<p>As a result, in an environment where a previous version of Visual Studio is installed, you cannot use <code>MSBuild</code> to build NintendoSDK projects.</p>
<p>In this situation, use <code>VisualStudioVersion</code> properties or environment variables to properly configure the settings for the Visual Studio version used by <code>MSBuild</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Visual Studio 2015, set <code>VisualStudioVersion</code> to <code>14.0</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_13">NX code is not generated, even if NX32/NX64 is added to the solution platforms for a project that was created with Generic selected as the platform.</h2>
<p>If either of the following methods was used to create the project, adding NX32/NX64 to the solution platforms generates code for the PC environment instead of for NX.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The project was created in an SDK environment where the NX Add-On package was not installed.</li>
  <li>The NX Add-On package was installed, but <strong>Generic</strong> was selected in the screen in the wizard for selecting the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid this problem, try the following procedure.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the applicable project in Visual Studio.</li>
  <li>In the Property Manager window, replace the imported property sheet <code>NintendoSdkSpec_Generic</code> with <code>NintendoSdkSpec_NX</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_14">The generated binary data is not the same, even though the build options and input files were not changed.</h2>
<p>When linking applications or dynamic modules, the linker attaches the build ID, that is used when debugging in VSI, to the binary data. If the UUID is used for this build ID, the generated binary data will not always be the same, even if there were no changes to the build options or input files, because a different UUID is generated for each build.</p>
<p>To work around this problem, you can set a hash value as the build ID. To make this change, open the project properties page in Visual Studio, and then select <strong>Linker</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Generate Build Identifier</strong>. The time it takes for the hash value to be calculated depends on the size of the binary data that is generated, and as a result, making this change generally increases linking time.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_15">The build fails with an unsupported option '--build-id=md5' error.</h2>
<p>If VSI for NX with a version earlier than 6.1 is installed after VSI for NX 6.1 or later was already installed, building applications would fail with the error message <strong>unsupported option '--build-id=md5'</strong>.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, reinstall using the procedures described in<a href="../Pages/Page_107342563.html#Anchor_107342563_InstallUninstallReinstall">Manual</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_16">Visual Studio sometimes stops responding for several minutes.</h2>
<p>If Visual Studio sometimes stops responding, the cause may be antivirus software. Try one of the following fixes for the problem.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete the <code>C:\Users\<em>&lt;YOUR_USER_NAME&gt;</em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VSCommon\12.0\SQM</code> directory.<ul><li>The &quot;<code>12.0</code>&quot; part of the name depends on which Visual Studio version you are using. Read it as &quot;14.0&quot; if you are using Visual Studio 2015, and read it as &quot;15.0&quot; if you are using Visual Studio 2017.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Remove <code>devenv.exe</code> from the WindowsDefender search targets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_17">Cannot handle exceptions thrown in SDK libraries.</h2>
<p>The <code>NX32</code> and <code>NX64</code> SDK libraries do not support C++ exceptions.<br />For this reason, when exceptions are thrown in the libraries, they are canceled.</p>
<p>If the code is only propagated to the application, you can enable C++ exceptions at build to make it possible to handle exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_18">Debugging stops when the system enters sleep mode.</h2>
<p>The specification calls for debugging with VSI to stop when the system enters sleep mode.<br />If you want resume debugging after the system wakes, reattach as described in <em>Debugging an Already Running Application</em> in <a href="../Pages/Page_126569850.html">Debugging a Built Program</a>.<br />By setting a breakpoint prior to the transition to sleep, you can attach immediately after waking.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_19">Installation of the VSI for NX package fails in environments without Internet connectivity.</h2>
<p>In environments where you cannot connect to the Internet, installation of the VSI for NX package sometimes fails.</p>
<p>If you cannot connect to the expiration server for the digital certificate, you cannot check the validity of the signature, and VSI cannot be installed.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, try the following procedure.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connect to the Internet<br />or<br />install an intermediate certificate issued by an authority higher than the digital certificate (CN = DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID Code Signing CA).</li>
  <li>Re-install the VSI for NX package.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_20">VSI for NX will fail to install if both Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2017 are installed.</h2>
<p>Installing VSI for NX can fail when both Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2017 are installed.</p>
<p>This failure is caused by a bug in the VSIXInstaller for Visual Studio 2017 (for version 15.4) where the Visual Studio extensions are not installed when Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 has already been installed. For more information, see the following page: <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/140674/vsixinstallerexe-throws-nullreferenceexception-whe.html"> <span class="external-link">vsixinstaller.exe throws NullReferenceException when Visual Studio Build Tools 2017 are installed</span></a>.</p>

<p>When the connection with Target Manager is unstable, sometimes logs will be omitted or the log API will run slowly. If you encounter these symptoms, improve the connection status with Target Manager.</p>
<p>The SD card log will work without an issue, even if the connection with Target Manager is unstable. If improving the connection status is problematic, consider using the SD card log.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_23">A &quot;(too far)&quot; message is added to the stack trace log, while the expected function names are not included.</h2>
<p>When using something like the default user exception handler, a &quot;(too far)&quot; message is added to the stack trace log together with unexpected function names that are not running.</p>
<p>This happens when there are instructions in local functions or in functions where symbol information is deleted due to dead-stripping. This behavior is by design. The stack trace output implementation works as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If no symbol information is present for a function that includes instructions, output the name of the closest function that has symbol information and output an offset from that function as the stack trace.</li>
  <li>If the offset is greater than the size used for the closest function distance, display the &quot;(too far)&quot; message.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can enable dead-stripping in Visual Studio project properties. To do so, select <a href="../Pages/Page_107320422.html#Anchor_107320422_h4_22">Linker &gt; General &gt; Enable Dead Strip</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Anchor_104492354_h3_3">Safe Mode does not appear to be recognized, even when started successfully.</h3>
<p>If you perform an operation to place the development hardware in Safe Mode, the screen will occasionally turn red on the EDEV MP. (On the EDEV EP2-2, the screen turns black instead of red, but the fan will stop spinning on occasion.)</p>
<p>If this occurs, start in Safe Mode by powering the development hardware off, and then powering it back on.<br />If the menu screen is displayed at this time, again place the development hardware in Safe Mode after turning it off.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_65">A fatal error occurs while a program is running.</h2>
<p>If you experience any fatal errors while a program is running, contact Nintendo support with the following information. </p>
<ul>
  <li>What you were doing when the error occurred<ul><li>The version of the SDK used to build the program</li><li>The firmware version displayed in DevMenu  <br /><ul><li>(The version information after &quot;Version: NintendoSDK Firmware for NX&quot;)</li></ul></li><li>Details about the program that was running when the error occurred (if possible)</li><li>A picture or screenshot of the screen on which the fatal error occurred (if possible)</li></ul></li>
  <li>The binary data that can be exported by executing the <code>DevMenuCommand error export &lt;absolute_host_file_path&gt;</code> command<ul><li>For more information, see the DevMenuCommand documentation.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screen will be displayed when a fatal error occurs.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_104492354_h1_12">Charging/Power</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_66">The EDEV system cannot be charged to 100 percent.</h2>
<p>When running in TV mode, the EDEV system sometimes cannot be charged all of the way to 100%.</p>
<p>This occurs because the charging settings are updated for safety purposes if the system temperature reaches a certain level.</p>
<p>To charge the system fully to 100%, you must perform one of the following to allow the system temperature to decrease.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Put the system into sleep mode.</li>
  <li>Remove the system from the dock and directly connect the AC adapter.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_104492354_h1_13">Cannot connect to the network.</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_67">nn::nifm::IsNetworkAvailable() does not become true.</h2>
<h3 id="Anchor_104492354_h3_4">Use the following procedure for both wired and wireless networks.</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_1">Confirm that the settings are imported using the settings manager for the development hardware.</h4>
<p>Importing the settings using the Windows tool will not affect the development hardware, and vice versa. Also <strong>ensure that the system is always restarted after importing settings</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_2">Check that the settings are as you intended.</h4>
<p>To check the imported content, see <a href="../Pages/Page_104465190.html#Anchor_104465190_SettingsManager_network">nifm Library &gt; Registering Network Connection Settings</a> to export and verify the settings.</p>
<p>The settings for authentication and encryption must be a combination supported by the SDK.</p>
<p>To include targets used automatically by the system, you must enable the settings used for automatic connections.</p>
<p>To connect to wireless access points with the stealth settings, you must set the <code>non_broadcast</code> option in the connection settings to <code>true</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_104492354_h3_5">Wired</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_3">Confirm that the USB Ethernet adapter is connected via the dock.</h4>
<p>Operations are not ensured when directly connected to the SDEV.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_4">Confirm that there are not multiple connected USB Ethernet adapters.</h4>
<p>Only one USB Ethernet adapter can be connected at a time. If multiple USB Ethernet adapters are connected, detach them all and then reconnect just the one you intend to use. </p>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_5">Confirm that you are using a correct combination of dock and SDEV hardware.</h4>
<p>The USB Ethernet adapter is not recognized when different versions of the dock and SDEV are used in combination.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_104492354_h3_6">Wireless</h3>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_6">Check that the DIP switches numbered 1 and 2 on the lower left of the back of the SDEV are turned on.</h4>
<p>If they are turned off, the wireless connection will be unstable.</p>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_7">Confirm that the security type is supported.</h4>
<p>For more information about the supported security types, see <a href="../Pages/Page_163420663.html#Anchor_163420663_Supported_ConnectionType">nifm Library &gt; Notes for Development Hardware - Supported Connection Types</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_104492354_h2_68">nn::nifm::IsNetworkAvailable() is true, but cannot connect to the external network</h2>
<h4 id="Anchor_104492354_h4_8">Check that you are using a line that can connect to the external network.</h4>
<p>As of NintendoSDK 0.11.0, proxy settings configured in the network settings are automatically applied. Also, any proxy settings configured using <code>curl_easy_setopt()</code> are ignored. To disable proxy settings, follow the procedure in <a href="../Pages/Page_104465190.html#Anchor_104465190_SettingsManager_network">nifm Library &gt; Registering Network Connection Settings</a> when configuring your connection settings or specify <code>0</code> for <code>CURLOPT_PROXYAUTOCONFIG</code> in <code>curl_easy_setopt()</code>.</p>
