<p>The first step in taking a profile is connecting to your dev kit. This is done by clicking the&nbsp;<span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288311/813981665.png" width="22" class="embedded-image" /></span>&nbsp;<strong>Sync</strong> button. This will pop open the&nbsp;<strong>Select a Profiling Scenario</strong>&nbsp;window that helps guide you through the steps. On the left side of the window are tabs to select one of the following scenarios:</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_706028402_h2_1">Attach: Connect to an already running game</h2>
<p>The most common situation is to simply&nbsp;<strong>Attach</strong>&nbsp;the profiler to your game that is already running (please ensure that your game is not connected to the debugger - if using Visual Studio, launch your game with <strong>Start without Debugging</strong>). When attaching to an already running game, you'll need to specify the NSS file in the&nbsp;<strong>Attach</strong>&nbsp;tab. If you performed <a href="../Pages/Page_685594274.html">Full Integration Setup</a>, you can just click the&nbsp;<strong>Autofill</strong>&nbsp;button and it will auto-detect and fill in the correct file. Otherwise, you'll need to locate your game's NSS file by clicking on the <span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288311/813981683.png" width="22" class="embedded-image" /></span>&nbsp;button.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_706028402_h2_2">Attach on Launch: Wait for the game to launch and then attach to it</h2>
<p>The profiler can wait for your game to launch and then immediately attach to it. However, make sure that your game is not connected to the debugger. If using Visual Studio, launch your game with <strong>Start without Debugging</strong>. As with&nbsp;<strong>Attach</strong>, you'll need to specify an NSS file.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_706028402_h2_3">Launch:&nbsp;The profiler starts the game and then attaches to it</h2>
<p>In this scenario, the profiler launches your game through Target Manager and then attaches to it. For this to work properly, you'll need your NINTENDO_SDK_ROOT environment variable to be set and pointing to your SDK root.</p>
<p>This scenario is the best way to profile the startup of your game.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_706028402_h2_4">In-Process Only: Attach to your game with in-process only profiling</h2>
<p>If you performed&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_685594274.html">Full Integration Setup</a>, then you can attach to your already running game. This mode restricts you to&nbsp;<span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288311/813981670.png" width="44" class="embedded-image" /></span>&nbsp;<strong>In-Process</strong> profiling, which is only appropriate if your game doesn't have threads that can migrate between cores. The benefit is that the profiler overhead is lower than&nbsp;<span class="embedded-file-wrapper "><img src="../Attachments/Attach_761288311/813981671.png" width="44" class="embedded-image" /></span>&nbsp;<strong>Out-of-Process</strong> profiling. This mode also allows the debugger to be attached to your game.</p>
<p>Please see&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_809639172.html">In-Process vs. Out-Of-Process</a> for clarification on the difference between these profiling modes.</p>
