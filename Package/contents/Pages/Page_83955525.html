<!-- Shape Animation -->
<div class="pagetitle" id="PageId_83955525">Shape Animation</div>
<div class="text_separate">
<p>Shape animations are set by creating a blend shape and animating the weight.<br />Vertex coordinates, normal vectors, tangent vectors, binormal vectors, and vertex colors can be animated.</p>
<p>Normal vector, tangent vector, and binormal vector animations sometimes appear differently under Maya than on the target platform.<br />Vertex color animations can only be verified on the target platform.</p>
<h1 id="Anchor_83955525_h1_1">Blend Shape</h1>
<p>Set the blend shape using <strong>Deform</strong> &gt; <strong>Create: Blend Shape</strong>.<br />The number of vertices and faces of the base shape must be the same as the values for the target shape.</p>
<p>Set the following options in the <strong>Basic</strong> tab to create the blend shape: set <strong>Origin</strong> to <strong>Local</strong>, set <strong>In-Between</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>, and set <strong>Check Topology</strong> to <strong>On</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Delete Targets</strong> option is set to <strong>On</strong> and the target objects have been deleted, the normal, tangent, binormal, and vertex color cannot be animated.<br />Exporting does not work properly if there is a mixture of targets with and without objects.<br />For this reason, we recommend that you do not delete target objects.</p>
<p>In <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, set <strong>Deformation Order</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Do not perform any operations that may change the number of vertices or faces of the base shape or target shape after creating the blend shape.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The positions of vertices can be changed after creating the blend shape.<br />However, tweak nodes must be located upstream from <code>blendShape</code> nodes.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Envelope</strong> of the <code>blendShape</code> node to adjust the overall degree of effect.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955871.html">plug-in for setting shape animations</a> to set the vertex attributes that will change when playing the shape animation.<br />Vertex coordinates and normal vectors, tangent vectors, and binormal vectors are updated by default. (Tangent and binormal vectors are only updated when using normal mapping or an anisotropic shader.)</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>The more vertex attributes to update, the greater the amount of data and the greater the processing load on the target platform.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>You cannot export key vertex attribute data that does not change between the base shape and target shape for materials in the same polygon group.<br />You cannot export a shape animation of a polygon group if none of the vertex attributes change.</p>
<p>If the members of a deformer set for a blend shape were edited, only the vertex attributes for surfaces that include a member vertex are updated at the time of animation playback.</p>
<p>When adding a target shape using <strong>Deform</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit: Blend Shape</strong> &gt; <strong>Add</strong>, set <strong>Add In-Between Target</strong> to <strong>OFF</strong> and <strong>Check Topology</strong> to <strong>ON</strong>.</p>
<p>Configure the target shape so that the base shape and all target shapes have unique names. In the intermediate file, the <code>transform</code> node name is used for the base shape name, and the name set by the Shape Editor is used for the target shape name.</p>
<p>Vertex attribute data for the target shape is output to the FMD file. Output an FMD file again if the number of target objects, shape, or vertex color changes.</p>
<p>If you use any of the UV projection mappings (Planar, Cylindrical, Spherical, or Automatic) after creating a blend shape, set <strong>Insert Before Deformers</strong> to <strong>ON</strong> for each projection mapping.</p>

    <p>Notes About Shape Editor</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If target visibility is disabled, that animation for that target will not be exported to the FSH file.</li>
      <li>If there are no target objects, the normal vector and color cannot be animated.<br />To animate the normal vector and color, <strong>rebuild the target</strong> and create the objects.</li>
      <li>If animation has been set for the group weight, animation curve data will be created automatically based on that data combined with the target weight and exported.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<h2 id="Anchor_83955525_h2_1">Vertex Color</h2>
<p>When using multi-vertex color, you can only animate color sets that exist for the base shape and all target shapes.<br />Base shape settings are used for the type and number of components associated with all vertex colors.</p>
<p>Assume, for example, that the color sets indicated with a circle (○) in the following table all exist.</p>
<table class="wrapped">
  <colgroup>
    <col />
    <col />
    <col />
    <col />
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Color Set Name</th>
      <th>Base Shape</th>
      <th>Target Shape A</th>
      <th>Target Shape B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>nw4f_color0</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>nw4f_color1</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
      <td align="center">&times;</td>
      <td align="center">&times;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>nw4f_color2</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>nw4f_color3</td>
      <td align="center">&times;</td>
      <td align="center">&times;</td>
      <td align="center">○</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>In this example, <code>color0</code> and <code>color2</code> will be animated.<br /><code>color1</code> is exported as a fixed value and is not animated.<br /><code>color3</code> is not exported at all because it is not included in the base shape.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955525_h2_2">Combining With Skinning</h2>
<p>To use blend shape in combination with skinning, prepare the following kind of construction history.</p>
<table class="codeblock">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <div class="codeblock"><pre>mesh node (after deformation)
↑
skinCluster node
↑
blendShape node
↑
mesh node (before deformation) (intermediate object)</pre></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>If there is an intermediate object in the middle of the history, as shown below, it is treated as the object's shape prior to deformation, and the shape animation is not output.</p>
<table class="codeblock">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <div class="codeblock"><pre>mesh node (after skinning deformation)
↑
skinCluster node
↑
mesh node (after blend shape deformation) (intermediate object)
↑
blendShape node
↑
mesh node (before deformation) (intermediate object)</pre></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
