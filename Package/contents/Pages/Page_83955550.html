<h1 id="Anchor_83955550_h1_1">Errors and Warnings</h1>
<p>This section describes the errors and warnings of the export plug-in.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955550_h2_1">Verifying Errors</h2>
<p>If an error or warning occurs during export, it is exported to the listener window.</p>
<p>Some errors are also displayed in a message box.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955550_h2_2">Error Types and Handling Errors</h2>
<p>The following list of current errors is presented in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>When an error is detected, the export process stops.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Animation file to merge is not found<br /></strong>
No animation files to merge could be found even though the export option <strong>Merge Animation Folder</strong> is enabled and a folder has been specified.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can't open file<br /></strong>
The file does not exist, cannot be opened, or cannot be overwritten.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comment is wrong<br /></strong>
The <strong>Comment</strong> export option includes one or more prohibited characters. Comments cannot include semicolons (;) or quotation marks (&quot;).</li>
  <li>
    <strong>DDS file is wrong</strong>
    <br />The content or format of the DDS file is invalid. See <a href="../Pages/Page_83956235.html#Anchor_83956235_tex_format">Supported Formats</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Image type is not supported<br /></strong>
An unsupported image file is being used. Currently, only TGA files and DDS files can be used as texture files.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Influence object is not outputted</strong>
    <br />
Nodes influenced by skinning are not output.  This error arises when <strong>Export Target</strong> is set as <strong>Selection</strong> and nodes influenced by skinning are not selected, or when no envelope has been assigned to a vertex even though a skinning modifier and Physique modifier are being applied.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Merge Animation Folder is wrong</strong>
    <br />
This occurs if the <strong>Merge Animation Folder</strong> export option includes prohibited characters. Full-space characters, half-space kana characters, and semicolons (;) cannot be used when specifying the Merge Animation Folder.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Merge Animation Name is wrong</strong>
    <br />
This occurs if the <strong>Merge Animation Name</strong> export option includes prohibited characters. Full-space characters, half-space kana characters, and semicolons (;) cannot be used when specifying the Merge Animation Name.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>No effective node<br /></strong>
There are no active nodes to output.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>No output file</strong>
    <br />All export specifications for the intermediate file are cleared, or only the export specification for texture data is selected but there is no texture to export.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Output File Name is wrong</strong>
    <br />The <strong>Output File Name</strong> Export option is blank, or the filename contains invalid characters.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Output Folder is wrong</strong>
    <br />The <strong>Output Folder</strong> Export option is blank, or the name contains invalid characters.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Path of fmd file to merge is wrong<br /></strong>
This error is generated when the <strong>Merge fmd File</strong> export option is selected and also an FMD file path is specified, but the FMD file to be merged does not exist or the path includes one or more prohibited characters. Full-space characters, half-space kana characters, and semicolons (;) cannot be used in the path.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Post-Export Script failed</strong>
    <br />An error occurred in the post-export script (MAX Script). See the listener window for a description of the error.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pre-Export Script failed</strong>
  </li>
  <li>An error occurred with the pre-export script (MAX Script). See the listener window for a description of the error.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Preset Name is wrong<br /></strong>
The <strong>Preset Name</strong> field was left blank or contains prohibited characters. Preset names cannot use the characters that cannot be used for filenames, nor double-width characters or single-width katakana characters or semicolons. Also, <strong>None</strong> cannot be used as the name for a preset.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sampler hint is wrong<br /></strong>
The sampler hint includes one or more prohibited characters.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sampler hint is duplicate</strong>
    <br />The same sampler hint is used more than once by the same material. Use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955852.html">Plug-In for Setting Sampler Attributes</a> to set hints that are not duplicates.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sampler name is wrong<br /></strong>
The sampler name includes one or more prohibited characters.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sampler name is duplicate</strong>
    <br />The same sampler name is used more than once by the same material. Use the <a href="../Pages/Page_83955852.html">Plug-In for Setting Sampler Attributes</a> to set names that are not duplicates.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Texture size is wrong</strong>
    <br />
The target platform cannot use textures with this size height and width.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>TGA file is wrong<br /></strong>
The TGA file contents are invalid.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>The number of weighted influence is over</strong>
    <br />The skinning weight is being distributed to more nodes than specified in the <a href="../Pages/Page_83956186.html#Anchor_83956186_config_file">config file</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wrong weighted vertices exist<br /></strong>
Vertices have a total skinning weight that is less than <code>1.0</code>. Make sure that you correct the weight value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_83955550_h2_3">Warning Types and Handling Warnings</h2>
<p>The following list of current warnings is presented in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>The export process continues even if a warning is detected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ftx file to merge is not found<br /></strong>
No FTX files to merge could be found even though the <strong>Merge ftx File</strong> export option is selected. Files are exported without merging.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Inheritance of node link info is off</strong>
    <br />One or more of the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, <strong>Link Information</strong>, or <strong>Inheritance</strong> settings are cleared. Objects do not display correctly unless all of these settings are selected.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Map channel does not exist</strong>
    <br />A channel <strong>n</strong> map is set in an object for which map channel <strong>n</strong> does not exist. <br />Because data cannot be exported in this state, the export forcibly pastes the UV information for map channel 1.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Material name is changed<br /></strong>
A material name exported to the intermediate file was changed because two or more materials had the same name.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Morpher modifier must be under skin (physique) modifier</strong>
    <br />The morpher is above skin (or physique). <br />The morpher modifier must be below the skin or physique modifier.</li>
  <li>The shape animation is not output.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Morpher target topology is different from original mesh</strong>
    <br />This error is generated when the morpher target shape and the base shape differ in terms of the number of vertices, number of surfaces, or number of vertex colors.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Node has no material</strong>
  </li>
  <li>No material has been set for a node. A dummy material is exported.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Node name is changed</strong>
    <br />If two or more nodes have the same name, or if prohibited characters are included in node names, the names are changed when the nodes are exported to the intermediate file.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shader is not supported<br /></strong>
A shader not supported by the Export plug-in is being used. When this warning occurs, the plug-in automatically adds and exports default material to the intermediate file.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Texture file doesn't exist.</strong>
    <br />The assigned texture does not exist.  If a path is included in the filename for a texture assigned to a material, the image saved in that path is referenced during export. <br />This warning occurs when no image exists in that path.  If the texture filename does not include a path, the image is referenced in the directory where the current MAX file is stored.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Texture name is changed<br /></strong>
The texture name contains prohibited characters. Prohibited characters are converted to an underscore (<code>_</code>), and then exported.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Texture type is not supported</strong>
  </li>
  <li>The only texture maps that can be used are bitmaps, normal maps, and composite maps.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>There are multiple texture files with the same name<br /></strong>
Two or more texture files have the same filename as the export target, but are in different folders or have a different extension.  Note that only one FTX file will be exported.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Zero normal exist</strong>
    <br />There is a normal vector with a length of zero. Lighting effects will not work properly. Fix this by using the <code>Edit normal</code> modifier or a smoothing group.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Zero tangent or binormal exists</strong>
    <br />There was a tangent or binormal vector with a length of zero, so it was replaced with (0, 1, 0) and exported. Be sure to correct the normal vector and UV coordinates.</li>
